            REQUIREMENTS ON TEMPLATE PARAMETERS

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for extracting local feature descriptors from an image.
                In particular, it fits polynomials to local pixel patches and allows you to 
                query the coefficients of these polynomials.  Additionally, the coefficients 
                may be intensity normalized by dividing them by the constant term of the fitted 
                polynomial and then the constant term is discarded. 

                Finally, the user can specify a downsampling rate.  If the template argument
                Downsample is set to 1 then feature extraction is performed at every pixel of
                an input image (except for a small area around the image border).  However,
                if Downsample is set to 2 then feature extraction is only performed at every
                other pixel location.  More generally, if Downsample is set to N then feature
                extraction is performed only every N pixels.  
                
            THREAD SAFETY
                Concurrent access to an instance of this object is not safe and should be protected
                by a mutex lock except for the case where you are copying the configuration 
                (via copy_configuration()) of a poly_image object to many other threads.  
                In this case, it is safe to copy the configuration of a shared object so long
                as no other operations are performed on it.
