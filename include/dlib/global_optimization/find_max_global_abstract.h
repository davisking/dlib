                      functions.
        ensures
            - This function performs global optimization on the set of given functions.
              The goal is to maximize the following objective function:
                 max_{i,x_i}: functions[i](x_i)
                 subject to the constraints on x_i defined by specs[i].
              Once found, the return value of find_max_global() is:
                make_pair(i, function_evaluation(x_i,functions[i](x_i))). 
              That is, we search for the settings of i and x that return the largest output
              and return those settings.
            - The search is performed using the global_function_search object.  See its
              documentation for details of the algorithm.
            - We set the global_function_search::get_solver_epsilon() parameter to
              solver_epsilon.  Therefore, the search will only attempt to find a global
              maximizer to at most solver_epsilon accuracy.  Once a local maximizer is
              found to that accuracy the search will focus entirely on finding other maxima
              elsewhere rather than on further improving the current local optima found so
              far.  That is, once a local maxima is identified to about solver_epsilon
              accuracy, the algorithm will spend all its time exploring the functions to
              find other local maxima to investigate.  An epsilon of 0 means it will keep
              solving until it reaches full floating point precision.  Larger values will
              cause it to switch to pure global exploration sooner and therefore might be
              more effective if your objective function has many local maxima and you don't
              care about a super high precision solution.
            - find_max_global() runs until one of the following is true:
                - The total number of calls to the provided functions is == num.max_calls
                - More than max_runtime time has elapsed since the start of this function.
                - should_stop(f(x)) returns true
            - Any variables that satisfy the following conditions are optimized on a log-scale:
                - The lower bound on the variable is > 0
                - The ratio of the upper bound to lower bound is >= 1000
                - The variable is not an integer variable
              We do this because it's common to optimize machine learning models that have
              parameters with bounds in a range such as [1e-5 to 1e10] (e.g. the SVM C
              parameter) and it's much more appropriate to optimize these kinds of
              variables on a log scale.  So we transform them by applying std::log() to
              them and then undo the transform via std::exp() before invoking the function
              being optimized.  Therefore, this transformation is invisible to the user
              supplied functions.  In most cases, it improves the efficiency of the
              optimizer.
            - The evaluations in initial_function_evals are incorporated into the solver state at
              startup.  This is useful if you have information from a previous optimization attempt
              or just know some good initial x values that should be attempted as a baseline.
              Giving initial_function_evals allows you to tell the solver to explicitly include
              those x values in its search.
            - if (tp.num_threads_in_pool() != 0) then
                - This function will make concurrent calls to the given functions.  In
                  particular, it will submit the calls to the functions as jobs to the
                  given thread_pool tp.
