This folder contains a copy of CBLAS (from http://www.netlib.org/blas/) which
has been setup so you can compile it with CMake.  It also only compiles the
part of CBLAS needed by dlib.

Most BLAS libraries come with CBLAS, however, some don't.  In particular, if
you are using the BLAS that comes with MATLAB then you will need this CBLAS
code linked into your own to get dlib working with MATLAB's built in BLAS.
