            REQUIREMENTS ON image_scanner_type
                image_scanner_type must be an implementation of 
                dlib/image_processing/scan_fhog_pyramid_abstract.h or
                dlib/image_processing/scan_image_custom_abstract.h or
                dlib/image_processing/scan_image_pyramid_abstract.h or
                dlib/image_processing/scan_image_boxes_abstract.h

            REQUIREMENTS ON image_array_type
                image_array_type must be an implementation of dlib/array/array_kernel_abstract.h 
                and it must contain objects which can be accepted by image_scanner_type::load().

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for learning the parameter vector needed to use a
                scan_image_pyramid, scan_fhog_pyramid, scan_image_custom, or
                scan_image_boxes object.  

                It learns the parameter vector by formulating the problem as a structural 
                SVM problem.  The exact details of the method are described in the paper 
                Max-Margin Object Detection by Davis E. King (http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00046).

                - This object attempts to learn a mapping from the given images to the
                  object locations given in truth_object_detections.  In particular, it
                  attempts to learn to predict truth_object_detections[i] based on
                  images[i].  Or in other words, this object can be used to learn a
                  parameter vector, w, such that an object_detector declared as:
                    object_detector<image_scanner_type> detector(scanner,get_overlap_tester(),w)
                  results in a detector object which attempts to compute the locations of
                  all the objects in truth_object_detections.  So if you called
                  detector(images[i]) you would hopefully get a list of rectangles back
                  that had truth_object_detections[i].size() elements and contained exactly
                  the rectangles indicated by truth_object_detections[i].

                  procedure.  You should set this parameter equal to the number of 
                  available processing cores on your machine.
                - #get_loss_per_missed_target() == 1
                - #get_loss_per_false_alarm() == 1
                - for all valid i:
                    - Within images[i] any detections that match against a rectangle in
                      ignore[i], according to ignore_overlap_tester, are ignored.  That is,
                      the optimizer doesn't care if the detector outputs a detection that
                      matches any of the ignore rectangles or if it fails to output a
                      detection for an ignore rectangle.  Therefore, if there are objects
                      in your dataset that you are unsure you want to detect or otherwise
                      don't care if the detector gets or doesn't then you can mark them
                      with ignore rectangles and the optimizer will simply ignore them.
