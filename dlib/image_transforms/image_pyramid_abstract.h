            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This is a simple functor to help create image pyramids.  In particular, it
                downsamples images at a ratio of N to N-1.

                Note that setting N to 1 means that this object functions like
                pyramid_disable (defined at the bottom of this file).

                WARNING, when mapping rectangles from one layer of a pyramid
                to another you might end up with rectangles which extend slightly
                outside your images.  This is because points on the border of an
                image at a higher pyramid layer might correspond to points outside
                images at lower layers.  So just keep this in mind.  Note also
                that it's easy to deal with.  Just say something like this:
                    rect = rect.intersect(get_rect(my_image)); // keep rect inside my_image

                  be in color.  Otherwise, the downsampling will be performed in a grayscale mode.
                - The location of a point P in original image will show up at point point_down(P)
                  in the #down image.

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This is a function object with an interface identical to pyramid_down (defined
                at the top of this file) except that it downsamples images at a ratio of infinity
                to 1.  That means it always outputs images of size 0 regardless of the size
                of the inputs.
                
                This is useful because it can be supplied to routines which take a pyramid_down
                function object and it will essentially disable pyramid processing.  This way,
                a pyramid oriented function can be turned into a regular routine which processes
                just the original undownsampled image.
