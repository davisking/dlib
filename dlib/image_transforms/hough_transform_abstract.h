            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for computing the line finding version of the Hough
                transform given some kind of edge detection image as input.  It also allows
                the edge pixels to be weighted such that higher weighted edge pixels
                contribute correspondingly more to the output of the Hough transform,
                allowing stronger edges to create correspondingly stronger line detections
                in the final Hough transform.

                  non-zero pixel in img is treated as a potential component of a line and
                  accumulated into the Hough accumulator #himg.  However, rather than
                  adding 1 to each relevant accumulator bin we add the value of the pixel
                  in img to each Hough accumulator bin.  This means that, if all the
                  pixels in img are 0 or 1 then this routine performs a normal Hough
                  transform.  However, if some pixels have larger values then they will be
                  weighted correspondingly more in the resulting Hough transform.

                  point in #himg corresponds to a line in the input box.  In particular,
                  the line for #himg[y][x] is given by get_line(point(x,y)).  Also, when
                  viewing the #himg image, the x-axis gives the angle of the line and the
                  y-axis the distance of the line from the center of the box.
