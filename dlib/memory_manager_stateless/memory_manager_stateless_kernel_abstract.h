            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object represents some kind of stateless memory manager or memory pool.  
                Stateless means that all instances (instances of the same kernel implementation that is) 
                of this object are identical and can be used interchangeably.  Note that 
                implementations are allowed to have some shared global state such as a 
                global memory pool.

            THREAD SAFETY
                This object is thread safe.  You may access it from any thread at any time
                without synchronizing access.
