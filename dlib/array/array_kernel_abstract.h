            REQUIREMENTS ON T

            REQUIREMENTS ON mem_manager
                must be an implementation of memory_manager/memory_manager_kernel_abstract.h or

            POINTERS AND REFERENCES TO INTERNAL DATA
                front(), back(), swap(), max_size(), set_size(), and operator[] 
                functions do not invalidate pointers or references to internal data.
                All other functions have no such guarantee.

            INITIAL VALUE
                size() == 0    
                max_size() == 0

            ENUMERATION ORDER
                The enumerator will iterate over the elements of the array in the
                order (*this)[0], (*this)[1], (*this)[2], ...

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object represents an ordered 1-dimensional array of items, 
                each item is associated with an integer value.  The items are 
                numbered from 0 though size() - 1 and the operator[] functions 
                run in constant time.  

                Also note that unless specified otherwise, no member functions
                of this object throw exceptions.
