            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object represents a factor graph or graphical model.  In 
                particular, this object defines the interface a MAP problem on
                a factor graph must implement if it is to be solved using the 
                find_max_factor_graph_nmplp() routine defined at the bottom of this file.  

                Note that there is no dlib::map_problem object.  What you are
                looking at here is simply the interface definition for a map problem.
                You must implement your own version of this object for the problem
                you wish to solve and then pass it to the find_max_factor_graph_nmplp() routine.


                Note also that a factor graph should not have any nodes which are 
                neighbors with themselves.  Additionally, the graph is undirected. This
                mean that if A is a neighbor of B then B must be a neighbor of A for
                the map problem to be valid.


                Finally, note that the "neighbor" relationship between nodes means the
                following:  Two nodes are neighbors if and only if there is a potential 
                function (implemented by the factor_value() method) which operates on 
                the nodes.
