            - This function is identical to find_max_box_constrained() as defined above
              except that it takes x_lower and x_upper as doubles rather than column
              vectors.  In this case, all variables have the same lower bound of x_lower
              and similarly have the same upper bound of x_upper.  Therefore, this is just
              a convenience function for calling find_max_box_constrained() when all
              variables have the same bound constraints.
