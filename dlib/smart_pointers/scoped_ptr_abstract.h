            REQUIREMENTS ON deleter
                Must be a function object that performs deallocation of a pointer
                of type T.  For example, see the default_deleter type defined above.
                It must also not throw when constructed or when performing a delete.

            INITIAL VALUE
                defined by constructor

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This is a smart pointer class inspired by the implementation of the scoped_ptr
                class found in the Boost C++ library.  So this is a simple smart pointer
                class which guarantees that the pointer contained within it will always be
                deleted.
                
                The class does not permit copying and so does not do any kind of
                reference counting.  Thus it is very simply and quite fast.
                
                Note that this class allows you to use pointers to arrays as well as
                pointers to single items.  To let it know that it is supposed to point
                to an array you have to declare it using the bracket syntax.  Consider
                the following examples:

                    // This is how you make a scoped pointer to a single thing
                    scoped_ptr<int> single_item(new int);
                    
                    // This is how you can use a scoped pointer to contain array pointers.
                    // Note the use of [].  This ensures that the proper version of delete
                    // is called.
                    scoped_ptr<int[]> array_of_ints(new int[50]);
