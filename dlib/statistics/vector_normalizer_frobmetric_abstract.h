                learned distance metric should satisfy num_triples() constraints which are,
                for all valid i and j:
                    length(T*anchor_vect-T*near_vects[i]) + 1 < length(T*anchor_vect - T*far_vects[j])
                for some appropriate linear transformation T which will be learned by
                vector_normalizer_frobmetric.

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for performing the FrobMetric distance metric
                learning algorithm described in the following paper:
                    A Scalable Dual Approach to Semidefinite Metric Learning
                    By Chunhua Shen, Junae Kim, Lei Wang, in CVPR 2011

                Therefore, this object is a tool that takes as input training triplets
                (anchor_vect, near, far) of vectors and attempts to learn a linear
                transformation T such that:
                    length(T*anchor_vect-T*near) + 1 < length(T*anchor_vect - T*far)
                That is, you give a bunch of anchor_vect vectors and for each anchor_vect
                you specify some vectors which should be near to it and some that should be
                far form it.  This object then tries to find a transformation matrix that
                makes the "near" vectors close to their anchors while the "far" vectors are
                farther away.

            THREAD SAFETY
                Note that this object contains a cached matrix object it uses 
                to store intermediate results for normalization.  This avoids
                needing to reallocate it every time this object performs normalization
                but also makes it non-thread safe.  So make sure you don't share
                instances of this object between threads.
