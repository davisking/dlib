                    void add (int a, int b, int& result) { result = a + b; }

                    // Also suppose you have a thread_pool named tp defined somewhere.
                    // Then you could do the following.
                    future<int> a, b, result;
                    a = 3;
                    b = 4;
                    // this function call causes another thread to execute a call to the add() function
                    // and passes in the int objects contained in a, b, and result
                    tp.add_task(add,a,b,result);
                    // This line will wait for the task in the thread pool to finish and then print the
                    // value in the result integer.  So it will print a 7.

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object represents a fixed size group of threads which you can
                submit tasks to and then wait for those tasks to be completed. 

                Note that setting the number of threads to 0 is a valid way to
                use this object.  It causes it to not contain any threads
                at all.  When tasks are submitted to the object in this mode
                the tasks are processed within the calling thread.  So in this
                mode any thread that calls add_task() is considered to be
                a thread_pool thread capable of executing tasks.

                Also note that all function objects are passed to the tasks
                by reference.  This means you should ensure that your function
                objects are not destroyed while tasks are still using them.
                (e.g. Don't let them go out of scope right after a call to 
                add_task())

            EXCEPTIONS
                Note that if an exception is thrown inside a task thread and 
                is not caught then the normal rule for uncaught exceptions in
                threads applies. That is, the application will be terminated
                and the text of the exception will be printed to standard error.
