            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                A loss layer is the final layer in a deep neural network.  It computes the
                task loss.  That is, it computes a number that tells us how well the
                network is performing on some task, such as predicting a binary label.  

                You can use one of the loss layers that comes with dlib (defined below).
                But importantly, you are able to define your own loss layers to suit your
                needs.  You do this by creating a class that defines an interface matching
                the one described by this EXAMPLE_LOSS_LAYER_ class.  Note that there is no
                dlib::EXAMPLE_LOSS_LAYER_ type.  It is shown here purely to document the
                interface that a loss layer must implement.

                A loss layer can optionally provide a to_label() method that converts the
                output of a network into a user defined type.  If to_label() is not
                provided then the operator() methods of add_loss_layer will not be
                available, but otherwise everything will function as normal.

                Finally, note that there are two broad flavors of loss layer, supervised
                and unsupervised.  The EXAMPLE_LOSS_LAYER_ as shown here is a supervised
                layer.  To make an unsupervised loss you simply leave out the
                training_label_type typedef and the truth iterator argument to
                compute_loss_value_and_gradient().

                This object implements the loss layer interface defined above by
                EXAMPLE_LOSS_LAYER_.  In particular, it implements a collection of
                multiclass classifiers.  An example will make its use clear.  So suppose,
                for example, that you want to make something that takes a picture of a
                vehicle and answers the following questions:
                    - What type of vehicle is it? A sedan or a truck?
                    - What color is it? red, green, blue, gray, or black?
                You need two separate multi-class classifiers to do this.  One to decide
                the type of vehicle, and another to decide the color.  The
                loss_multimulticlass_log_ allows you to pack these two classifiers into one
                neural network.  This means that when you use the network to process an
                image it will output 2 labels for each image, the type label and the color
                label.  

                To create a loss_multimulticlass_log_ for the above case you would
                construct it as follows:
                    std::map<std::string,std::vector<std::string>> labels;
                    labels["type"] = {"sedan", "truck"};
                    labels["color"] = {"red", "green", "blue", "gray", "black"};
                    loss_multimulticlass_log_ myloss(labels);
                Then you could use myloss with a network object and train it to do this
                task.  More generally, you can use any number of classifiers and labels
                when using this object.  Finally, each of the classifiers uses a standard
                multi-class logistic regression loss.

                - The most important thing this function does is decide what detector
                  windows should be used.  This is done by finding a set of detector
                  windows that are sized such that:
                    - When slid over an image pyramid, each box in boxes will have an
                      intersection-over-union with one of the detector windows of at least
                      min_detector_window_overlap_iou.  That is, we will make sure that
                      each box in boxes could potentially be detected by one of the
                      detector windows.  This essentially comes down to picking detector
                      windows with aspect ratios similar to the aspect ratios in boxes.
                      Note that we also make sure that each box can be detected by a window
                      with the same label.  For example, if all the boxes had the same
                      aspect ratio but there were 4 different labels used in boxes then
                      there would be 4 resulting detector windows, one for each label.
                    - The longest edge of each detector window is target_size pixels in
                      length, unless the window's shortest side would be less than
                      min_target_size pixels in length.  In this case the shortest side
                      will be set to min_target_size length, and the other side sized to
                      preserve the aspect ratio of the window.  
                  This means that target_size and min_target_size control the size of the
                  detector windows, while the aspect ratios of the detector windows are
                  automatically determined by the contents of boxes.  It should also be
                  emphasized that the detector isn't going to be able to detect objects
                  smaller than any of the detector windows.  So consider that when setting
                  these sizes.

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object implements the loss layer interface defined above by
                EXAMPLE_LOSS_LAYER_.  In particular, it allows you to learn to map objects
                into a vector space where objects sharing the same class label are close to
                each other, while objects with different labels are far apart.   

                To be specific, it optimizes the following loss function which considers
                all pairs of objects in a mini-batch and computes a different loss depending 
                on their respective class labels.  So if objects A1 and A2 in a mini-batch
                share the same class label then their contribution to the loss is:
                    max(0, length(A1-A2)-get_distance_threshold() + get_margin())

                While if A1 and B1 have different class labels then their contribution to
                the loss function is:
                    max(0, get_distance_threshold()-length(A1-B1) + get_margin())

                Therefore, this loss layer optimizes a version of the hinge loss.
                Moreover, the loss is trying to make sure that all objects with the same
                label are within get_distance_threshold() distance of each other.
                Conversely, if two objects have different labels then they should be more
                than get_distance_threshold() distance from each other in the learned
                embedding.  So this loss function gives you a natural decision boundary for
                deciding if two objects are from the same class.

                Finally, the loss balances the number of negative pairs relative to the
                number of positive pairs.  Therefore, if there are N pairs that share the
                same identity in a mini-batch then the algorithm will only include the N
                worst non-matching pairs in the loss.  That is, the algorithm performs hard
                negative mining on the non-matching pairs.  This is important since there
                are in general way more non-matching pairs than matching pairs.  So to
                avoid imbalance in the loss this kind of hard negative mining is useful.

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object implements the loss layer interface defined above by
                EXAMPLE_LOSS_LAYER_.  In particular, it implements the pairwise ranking
                loss described in the paper:
                    Optimizing Search Engines using Clickthrough Data by Thorsten Joachims

                This is the same loss function used by the dlib::svm_rank_trainer object.
                Therefore, it is generally appropriate when you have a two class problem
                and you want to learn a function that ranks one class before the other.  

                So for example, suppose you have two classes of data.  Objects of type A
                and objects of type B.  Moreover, suppose that you want to sort the objects
                so that A objects always come before B objects.  This loss will help you
                learn a function that assigns a real number to each object such that A
                objects get a larger number assigned to them than B objects.  This lets you
                then sort the objects according to the output of the neural network and
                obtain the desired result of having A objects come before B objects.

                The training labels should be positive values for objects you want to get
                high scores and negative for objects that should get small scores.  So
                relative to our A/B example, you would give A objects labels of +1 and B
                objects labels of -1.  This should cause the learned network to give A
                objects large positive values and B objects negative values.


                Finally, the specific loss function is:
                    For all pairs of positive vs negative training examples A_i and B_j respectively:
                      sum_ij:  max(0, B_i - A_j + margin_ij)
                where margin_ij = the label for A_j minus the label for B_i.  If you
                always use +1 and -1 labels then the margin is always 2.  However, this
                formulation allows you to give certain training samples different weight by
                adjusting the training labels appropriately.
