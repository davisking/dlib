            REQUIREMENTS ON pixel_type
                pixel_type just needs to be something that matches the pixel memory
                layout of whatever OpenCV image you are going to use with this object.
                For example, you might use unsigned char or bgr_pixel depending
                on what you needed.

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is meant to be used as a simple wrapper around the OpenCV
                IplImage struct or Mat object.  Using this class template you can turn
                an OpenCV image into something that looks like a normal dlib style 
                image object.

                So you should be able to use cv_image objects with many of the image
                processing functions in dlib as well as the GUI tools for displaying
                images on the screen.

                Note that this object does NOT take ownership of the image data you 
                give to it.  This means it is up to you to make sure the OpenCV image
                is properly freed at some point.  This also means that an instance of 
                this object can only be used as long as the OpenCV image it references 
                remains valid, since a cv_image just points to the OpenCV image's 
                memory directly.
