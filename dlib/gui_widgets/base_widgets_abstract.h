        GENERAL REMARKS
            This file contains objects that are useful for creating complex drawable 
            widgets.

        THREAD SAFETY
            All objects and functions defined in this file are thread safe.  You may
            call them from any thread without serializing access to them.

        EVENT HANDLERS
            If you derive from any of the drawable objects and redefine any of the on_*() 
            event handlers then you should ensure that your version calls the same event 
            handler in the base object so that the base class part of your object will also 
            be able to process the event. 

            Also note that all event handlers, including the user registered callback
            functions, are executed in the event handling thread.   Additionally,
            the drawable::m mutex will always be locked while these event handlers
            are running.  Also, don't rely on get_thread_id() always returning the 
            same ID from inside event handlers.

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object represents a 2D Cartesian graph that you can zoom into and
                out of.  It is a graphical widget that draws a rectangle with 
                a horizontal and vertical scroll bar that allow the user to scroll
                around on a Cartesian graph that is much larger than the actual 
                area occupied by this object on the screen.  It also allows 
                the user to zoom in and out.

                To use this object you inherit from it and make use of its public and
                protected member functions.  It provides functions for converting between
                pixel locations and the points in our 2D Cartesian graph so that when the 
                user is scrolling/zooming the widget you can still determine where
                things are to be placed on the screen and what screen pixels correspond
                to in the Cartesian graph.

                Note that the Cartesian graph in this object is bounded by the point
                (0,0), corresponding to the upper left corner when we are zoomed all 
                the way out, and max_graph_point() which corresponds to the lower right 
                corner when zoomed all the way out. The value of max_graph_point() is 
                determined automatically from the size of this object's on screen 
                rectangle and the value of min_zoom_scale() which determines how far 
                out you can zoom.

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object represents a 2D region of arbitrary size that is displayed
                within a possibly smaller scrollable gui widget.  That is, it is a 
                graphical widget that draws a rectangle with a horizontal and vertical 
                scroll bar that allows the user to scroll around on a region that is much 
                larger than the actual area occupied by this object on the screen. 
                
                To use this object you inherit from it and make use of its public and
                protected member functions.  It provides a function, total_rect(), that
                tells you where the 2D region is on the screen.  You draw your stuff 
                inside total_rect() as you would normally except that you only modify 
                pixels that are also inside display_rect().  When the user moves the
                scroll bars the position of total_rect() is updated accordingly, causing
                the widget's content to scroll across the screen.
