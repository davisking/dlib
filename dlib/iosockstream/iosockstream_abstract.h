                This is an iostream object that reads/writes from a TCP network connection.

                Note that any attempt to read from this stream will automatically flush the
                stream's output buffers.  

            THREAD SAFETY
                It is not safe to touch this object from more than one thread at a time.
                Therefore, you should mutex lock it if you need to do so.
