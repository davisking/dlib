            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object represents a set of integers which is partitioned into
                a number of disjoint subsets.  It supports the two fundamental operations
                of finding which subset a particular integer belongs to as well as
                merging subsets.  It also allows you to find out how big each subset is.  It 
                is therefore essentially the same thing as dlib::disjoint_subsets, except
                it also keeps track of of the size of each subset.
