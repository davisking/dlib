            REQUIREMENTS ON feature_extractor 
                - must be an object with an interface compatible with dlib::hog_image

            INITIAL VALUE

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for performing image feature extraction.  In
                particular, it wraps another image feature extractor and converts
                the wrapped image feature vectors into sparse indicator vectors.  It does
                this by finding the nearest neighbor for each feature vector and returning an
                indicator vector that is zero everywhere except for the position indicated by 
                the nearest neighbor.  


            THREAD SAFETY
                Concurrent access to an instance of this object is not safe and should be protected
                by a mutex lock except for the case where you are copying the configuration 
                (via copy_configuration()) of a nearest_neighbor_feature_image object to many other 
                threads.  In this case, it is safe to copy the configuration of a shared object so 
                long as no other operations are performed on it.


            NOTATION 
                let BASE_FE denote the base feature_extractor object contained inside 
                the nearest_neighbor_feature_image.
