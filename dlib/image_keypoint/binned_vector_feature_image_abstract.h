            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for performing image feature extraction.  In
                particular, it wraps another image feature extractor and converts the
                wrapped image feature vectors into a high dimensional sparse vector.  For
                example, if the lower level feature extractor outputs the vector [3,4,5]
                and this vector is hashed into the second bin of four bins then the output
                sparse vector is:
                    [0,0,0,0, 3,4,5,1, 0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0]. 
                That is, the output vector has a dimensionality that is equal to the number
                of hash bins times the dimensionality of the lower level vector plus one.
                The value in the extra dimension concatenated onto the end of the vector is
                always a constant value of of 1 and serves as a bias value.  This means
                that, if there are N hash bins, these vectors are capable of representing N
                different linear functions, each operating on the vectors that fall into
                their corresponding hash bin.


            THREAD SAFETY
                Concurrent access to an instance of this object is not safe and should be
                protected by a mutex lock except for the case where you are copying the
                configuration (via copy_configuration()) of a binned_vector_feature_image
                object to many other threads.  In this case, it is safe to copy the
                configuration of a shared object so long as no other operations are
                performed on it.
