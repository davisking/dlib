            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for distributing the work involved in solving a 
                dlib::structural_svm_problem across many computers.  The best way to understand
                its use is via example:

                First, suppose you have defined a structural_svm_problem object by inheriting from 
                it and defining the appropriate virtual functions.  You could solve it by passing 
                an instance to the oca optimizer.  However, if your separation oracle takes a long 
                time to evaluate then the optimization will take a long time to solve.  To speed 
                this up we can distribute the calls to the separation oracle across many computers.  
                
                To make this concrete, lets imagine you want to distribute the work across three 
                computers. You can accomplish this by creating four programs.  One containing a 
                svm_struct_controller_node and three containing svm_struct_processing_nodes.

                The programs might look like this:

                Controller program:
                    int main() 
                    {
                        svm_struct_controller_node cont;
                        cont.set_c(100);
                        // Tell cont where the processing nodes are on your network.
                        cont.add_processing_node("192.168.1.10:12345");
                        cont.add_processing_node("192.168.1.11:12345");
                        cont.add_processing_node("192.168.1.12:12345");
                        matrix<double> w;
                        oca solver;
                        cont(solver, w); // Run the optimization.
                        // After this finishes w will contain the solution vector.
                    }

                Processing programs (they are all the same, except that each loads a different subset
                of the training data):
                    int main()
                    {
                        // Put one third of your data into this problem object.  How you do this depends on your problem.
                        your_structural_svm_problem problem;
                        svm_struct_processing_node node(problem, 12345, number_of_cores_on_this_computer);
                        cout << "hit enter to terminate this program" << endl;
                        cin.get();
                    }

                  Smaller values may result in a more accurate solution but take longer 
                  to execute.  Specifically, the algorithm stops when the average sample
                  risk (i.e. R(w) as defined by the dlib::structural_svm_problem object) is 
                  within epsilon of its optimal value.

                  Also note that sample risk is an upper bound on a sample's loss.  So
                  you can think of this epsilon value as saying "solve the optimization
                  problem until the average loss per sample is within epsilon of it's 
                  optimal value".
        !*/

                - if (get_max_cache_size() != 0) then
                    - The solver will not stop when the average sample risk is within
                      get_epsilon() of its optimal value.  Instead, it will keep running
                      but will run the optimizer completely on the cache until the average
                      sample risk is within #get_cache_based_epsilon() of its optimal
                      value.  This means that it will perform this additional refinement in
                      the solution accuracy without making any additional calls to the
                      separation_oracle().  This is useful when using a nuclear norm
                      regularization term because it allows you to quickly solve the
                      optimization problem to a high precision, which in the case of a
                      nuclear norm regularized problem means that many of the learned
                      matrices will be low rank or very close to low rank due to the
                      nuclear norm regularizer.  This may not happen without solving the
                      problem to a high accuracy or their ranks may be difficult to
                      determine, so the extra accuracy given by the cache based refinement
                      is very useful.  Finally, note that we include the nuclear norm term
                      as part of the "risk" for the purposes of determining when to stop.

                  this object will solve:
                    Minimize: h(w) == 0.5*dot(w,w) + C*R(w) + regularization_strength*nuclear_norm_of(part of w)

                  exactly the matrix reshape(rowm(w, range(first_dimension, first_dimension+rows*cols-1)), rows, cols).
                  Therefore, if you think of the w vector as being the concatenation of a
                  bunch of matrices then you can use multiple calls to add_nuclear_norm_regularizer() 
                  to add nuclear norm regularization terms to any of the matrices packed into w.
