            REQUIREMENTS ON any_trainer
                must be an instantiation of the dlib::any_trainer template.   

            REQUIREMENTS ON label_type_
                label_type_ must be default constructable, copyable, and comparable using
                operator < and ==.  It must also be possible to write it to an std::ostream
                using operator<<.

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for turning a bunch of binary classifiers into a 
                multiclass classifier.  It does this by training the binary classifiers 
                in a one vs. all fashion.  That is, if you have N possible classes then 
                it trains N binary classifiers which are then used to vote on the identity 
                of a test sample.

                This object works with any kind of binary classification trainer object
                capable of being assigned to an any_trainer object.  (e.g. the svm_nu_trainer)
