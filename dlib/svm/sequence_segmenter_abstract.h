            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object defines the interface a feature extractor must implement if it
                is to be used with the sequence_segmenter defined at the bottom of this
                file.  
                
                The model used by sequence_segmenter objects is the following.  Given an
                input sequence x, predict an output label sequence y such that:
                    y == argmax_Y dot(w, PSI(x,Y))
                Where w is a parameter vector and the label sequence defines a segmentation
                of x.

                Recall that a sequence_segmenter uses the BIO or BILOU tagging model and is
                also an instantiation of the dlib::sequence_labeler.  Selecting to use the
                BIO model means that each element of the label sequence y takes on one of
                three possible values (B, I, or O) and together these labels define a
                segmentation of the sequence.  For example, to represent a segmentation of
                the sequence of words "The dog ran to Bob Jones" where only "Bob Jones" was
                segmented out we would use the label sequence OOOOBI.  The BILOU model is
                similar except that it uses five different labels and each segment is
                labeled as U, BL, BIL, BIIL, BIIIL, and so on depending on its length.
                Therefore, the BILOU model is able to more explicitly model the ends of the
                segments than the BIO model, but has more parameters to estimate.
                
                Keeping all this in mind, the purpose of a sequence_segmenter is to take
                care of the bookkeeping associated with creating BIO/BILOU tagging models
                for segmentation tasks.  In particular, it presents the user with a
                simplified version of the interface used by the dlib::sequence_labeler.  It
                does this by completely hiding the BIO/BILOU tags from the user and instead
                exposes an explicit sub-segment based labeling representation.  It also
                simplifies the construction of the PSI() feature vector. 

                Like in the dlib::sequence_labeler, PSI() is a sum of feature vectors, each
                derived from the entire input sequence x but only part of the label
                sequence y.  In the case of the sequence_segmenter, we use an order one
                Markov model.  This means that 
                    PSI(x,y) == sum_i XI(x, y_{i-1}, y_{i}, i)
                where the sum is taken over all the elements in the sequence.  At each
                element we extract a feature vector, XI(), that is expected to encode
                important details describing what the i-th position of the sequence looks
                like in the context of the current and previous labels.  To do this, XI()
                is allowed to look at any part of the input sequence x, the current and
                previous labels, and of course it must also know the position in question, i.  
                
                The sequence_segmenter simplifies this further by decomposing XI() into
                components which model the current window around each position as well as
                the conjunction of the current window around each position and the previous
                label.  In particular, the sequence_segmenter only asks a user to provide a
                single feature vector which characterizes a position of the sequence
                independent of any labeling.  We denote this feature vector by ZI(x,i), where
                x is the sequence and i is the position in question.  
                
                For example, suppose we use a window size of 3 and BIO tags, then we can
                put all this together and define XI() in terms of ZI().  To do this, we can
                think of XI() as containing 12*3 slots which contain either a zero vector
                or a ZI() vector.  Each combination of window position and labeling has a
                different slot.  To explain further, consider the following examples where
                we have annotated which parts of XI() correspond to each slot.  

                If the previous and current label are both B and we use a window size of 3
                then XI() would be instantiated as:
                    XI(x, B, B, i) = [ZI(x,i-1)  \ 
                                      ZI(x,i)     > If current label is B
                                      ZI(x,i+1)  /  
                                      0          \                        
                                      0           > If current label is I

                    the various label combination instead of 12*3.

                    Finally, while not shown here, we also include indicator features in
                    XI() to model label transitions and individual label biases.  These are
                    12 extra features in the case of the BIO tagging model and 30 extra in
                    the case of the BILOU tagging model.

            ensures
                - This function computes the ZI(x,position) feature vector.  This is a
                  feature vector which should capture the properties of x[position] that
                  are informative relative to the sequence segmentation task you are trying
                  to perform.
                - ZI(x,position) is returned as a sparse vector by invoking set_feature().
                  For example, to set the feature with an index of 55 to the value of 1
                  this method would call:
                    set_feature(55);
                  Or equivalently:
                    set_feature(55,1);
                  Therefore, the first argument to set_feature is the index of the feature
                  to be set while the second argument is the value the feature should take.
                  Additionally, note that calling set_feature() multiple times with the
                  same feature index does NOT overwrite the old value, it adds to the
                  previous value.  For example, if you call set_feature(55) 3 times then it
                  will result in feature 55 having a value of 3.
                - This function only calls set_feature() with feature_index values < num_features()

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for segmenting a sequence of objects into a set of
                non-overlapping chunks.  An example sequence segmentation task is to take
                English sentences and identify all the named entities.  In this example,
                you would be using a sequence_segmenter to find all the chunks of
                contiguous words which refer to proper names.

                Internally, the sequence_segmenter uses the BIO (Begin, Inside, Outside) or
                BILOU (Begin, Inside, Last, Outside, Unit) sequence tagging model.
                Moreover, it is implemented using a dlib::sequence_labeler object and
                therefore sequence_segmenter objects are examples of chain structured
                conditional random field style sequence taggers. 

            THREAD SAFETY
                It is always safe to use distinct instances of this object in different
                threads.  However, when a single instance is shared between threads then
                the following rules apply:
                    It is safe to call the const members of this object from multiple
                    threads so long as the feature_extractor is also threadsafe.  This is
                    because the const members are purely read-only operations.  However,
                    any operation that modifies a sequence_segmenter is not threadsafe.
