            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object defines the interface a feature extractor must implement
                if it is to be used with the assignment_function defined at the bottom
                of this file.  
                
                The model used by assignment_function objects is the following.  
                Given two sets of objects, the Left Hand Set (LHS) and Right Hand Set (RHS),
                find a one-to-one mapping M from LHS into RHS such that:
                    M == argmax_m  sum_{l in LHS} match_score(l,m(l))
                Where match_score() returns a scalar value indicating how good it is
                to say l maps to the RHS element m(l).  Additionally, in this model, 
                m() is allowed to indicate that l doesn't map to anything, and in this 
                case it is excluded from the sum.    

                Finally, match_score() is defined as: 
                    match_score(l,r) == dot(w, PSI(l,r))
                where l is an element of LHS, r is an element of RHS, and
                w is a parameter vector.

                Therefore, a feature extractor defines how the PSI() feature vector 
                is calculated.  In particular, PSI() is defined by the get_features()
                method of this class.

            THREAD SAFETY
                Instances of this object are required to be threadsafe, that is, it should
                be safe for multiple threads to make concurrent calls to the member
                functions of this object.

                  with w vectors where the first num_nonnegative_weights() elements of w
                  are >= 0.  That is, it should be the case that w(i) >= 0 for all i <

                  learned w should have a certain number of non-negative elements.
                  Therefore, if you do not provide a num_nonnegative_weights() method in

                  that all elements of the w parameter vector may be any value.

            REQUIREMENTS ON feature_extractor
                It must be an object that implements an interface compatible with 
                the example_feature_extractor discussed above.

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for solving the optimal assignment problem given a 
                user defined method for computing the quality of any particular assignment. 

                To define this precisely, suppose you have two sets of objects, a 
                Left Hand Set (LHS) and a Right Hand Set (RHS) and you want to 
                find a one-to-one mapping M from LHS into RHS such that:
                    M == argmax_m  sum_{l in LHS} match_score(l,m(l))
                Where match_score() returns a scalar value indicating how good it is
                to say l maps to the RHS element m(l).  Additionally, in this model, 
                m() is allowed to indicate that l doesn't map to anything, and in this 
                case it is excluded from the sum.    

                Finally, this object supports match_score() functions of the form: 
                    match_score(l,r) == dot(w, PSI(l,r))
                where l is an element of LHS, r is an element of RHS, w is a parameter 
                vector, and PSI() is defined by the feature_extractor template argument.  

            THREAD SAFETY
                It is always safe to use distinct instances of this object in different
                threads.  However, when a single instance is shared between threads then
                the following rules apply:
                    It is safe to call the const members of this object from multiple
                    threads so long as the feature_extractor is also threadsafe.  This is
                    because the const members are purely read-only operations.  However,
                    any operation that modifies an assignment_function is not threadsafe.

                - When deciding how to match LHS to RHS, this object can operate in one of 
                  two modes.  In the default mode, this object will indicate that there is

                  Another way to understand this distinction is to consider an example.

                  it is possible for this object to indicate that there are anywhere between
