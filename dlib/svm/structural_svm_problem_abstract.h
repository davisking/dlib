            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for solving the optimization problem associated with
                a structural support vector machine.  A structural SVM is a supervised
                machine learning method for learning to predict complex outputs.  This is
                contrasted with a binary classifier which makes only simple yes/no
                predictions.  A structural SVM, on the other hand, can learn to predict
                complex outputs such as entire parse trees or DNA sequence alignments.  To
                do this, it learns a function F(x,y) which measures how well a particular
                data sample x matches a label y.  When used for prediction, the best label
                for a new x is given by the y which maximizes F(x,y).   

                To use this object you inherit from it, provide implementations of its four
                pure virtual functions, and then pass your object to the oca optimizer.
                Also, you should only pass an instance of this object to the oca optimizer
                once.  That is, the act of using a structural_svm_problem instance with the
                oca solver "uses" the structural_svm_problem instance.  If you want to
                solve the same problem multiple times then you must use a fresh instance of
                your structural_svm_problem.


                To define the optimization problem precisely, we first introduce some notation:
                    - let PSI(x,y)    == the joint feature vector for input x and a label y.
                    - let F(x,y|w)    == dot(w,PSI(x,y)).  
                    - let LOSS(idx,y) == the loss incurred for predicting that the idx-th training 
                      sample has a label of y.  Note that LOSS() should always be >= 0 and should
                      become exactly 0 when y is the correct label for the idx-th sample.
                    - let x_i == the i-th training sample.
                    - let y_i == the correct label for the i-th training sample.
                    - The number of data samples is N.

                Then the optimization problem solved using this object is the following:
                    Minimize: h(w) == 0.5*dot(w,w) + C*R(w)

                    Where R(w) == sum from i=1 to N: 1/N * sample_risk(i,w)
                    and sample_risk(i,w) == max over all Y: LOSS(i,Y) + F(x_i,Y|w) - F(x_i,y_i|w)
                    and C > 0

                

                For an introduction to structured support vector machines you should consult 
                the following paper: 
                    Predicting Structured Objects with Support Vector Machines by 
                    Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yisong Yue, and Chun-nam Yu

                For a more detailed discussion of the particular algorithm implemented by this
                object see the following paper:

                    Note that this object is essentially a tool for solving the 1-Slack structural
                    SVM with margin-rescaling.  Specifically, see Algorithm 3 in the above referenced 
                    paper.

                  Also note that sample risk is an upper bound on a sample's loss.  So
                  you can think of this epsilon value as saying "solve the optimization
                  problem until the average loss per sample is within epsilon of it's

                      sample risk is within #get_cache_based_epsilon() of its optimal
                      value.  This means that it will perform this additional refinement in
                      the solution accuracy without making any additional calls to the
                      separation_oracle().  This is useful when using a nuclear norm
                      regularization term because it allows you to quickly solve the
                      optimization problem to a high precision, which in the case of a
                      nuclear norm regularized problem means that many of the learned
                      matrices will be low rank or very close to low rank due to the
                      nuclear norm regularizer.  This may not happen without solving the
                      problem to a high accuracy or their ranks may be difficult to
                      determine, so the extra accuracy given by the cache based refinement
                      is very useful.  Finally, note that we include the nuclear norm term
                      as part of the "risk" for the purposes of determining when to stop.
