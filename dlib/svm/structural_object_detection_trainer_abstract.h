            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for learning to detect objects in images based on a 
                set of labeled images. The training procedure produces an object_detector 
                which can be used to predict the locations of objects in new images.

                Note that this is just a convenience wrapper around the structural_svm_object_detection_problem 
                to make it look similar to all the other trainers in dlib.
