            REQUIREMENTS ON kernel_type
                is a kernel function object as defined in dlib/svm/kernel_abstract.h 

            INITIAL VALUE
                - dictionary_size() == 0
                - samples_trained() == 0

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This is an implementation of an online algorithm for recursively estimating the
                centroid of a sequence of training points.  It uses the sparsification technique
                described in the paper The Kernel Recursive Least Squares Algorithm by Yaakov Engel.

                This object then allows you to compute the distance between the centroid 
                and any test points.  So you can use this object to predict how similar a test
                point is to the data this object has been trained on (larger distances from the
                centroid indicate dissimilarity/anomalous points).

                Also note that the algorithm internally keeps a set of "dictionary vectors" 
                that are used to represent the regression function.  You can force the 
                algorithm to use no more than a set number of vectors by setting 
                the 3rd constructor argument to whatever you want.  However, note that 
                doing this causes the algorithm to bias it's results towards more 
                recent training examples.
