            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object defines the interface a feature extractor must implement
                if it is to be used with the sequence_labeler defined at the bottom
                of this file.  
                
                The model used by sequence_labeler objects is the following.  
                Given an input sequence x, predict an output label sequence y
                such that:
                    y == argmax_Y dot(w, PSI(x,Y))
                    Where w is a parameter vector.

                Therefore, a feature extractor defines how the PSI(x,y) feature vector 
                is calculated.  It also defines how many output labels there are as 
                well as the order of the model.  

                Finally, note that PSI(x,y) is a sum of feature vectors, each derived 
                from the entire input sequence x but only part of the label sequence y.
                Each of these constituent feature vectors is defined by the get_features() 
                method of this class.

                - This function computes the part of PSI() corresponding to the x[position]
                  element of the input sequence.  Moreover, this part of PSI() is returned as 
                  a sparse vector by invoking set_feature().  For example, to set the feature 
                  with an index of 55 to the value of 1 this method would call:
                    set_feature(55);

                    set_feature(55,1);
                  Therefore, the first argument to set_feature is the index of the feature 
                  to be set while the second argument is the value the feature should take.
                  Additionally, note that calling set_feature() multiple times with the same 
                  feature index does NOT overwrite the old value, it adds to the previous 
                  value.  For example, if you call set_feature(55) 3 times then it will
                  result in feature 55 having a value of 3.
                - This function only calls set_feature() with feature_index values < num_features()

                  are >= 0.  That is, it should be the case that w(i) >= 0 for all i <

                  learned w should have a certain number of non-negative elements.
                  Therefore, if you do not provide a num_nonnegative_weights() method in
                  your feature extractor then it will default to a value of 0, indicating
                  that all elements of the w parameter vector may be any value.

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for doing sequence labeling.  In particular, it is
                capable of representing sequence labeling models such as those produced by
                Hidden Markov SVMs or Chain Structured Conditional Random fields.  See the
                following papers for an introduction to these techniques:
                    - Hidden Markov Support Vector Machines by 
                      Y. Altun, I. Tsochantaridis, T. Hofmann
                    - Shallow Parsing with Conditional Random Fields by 
                      Fei Sha and Fernando Pereira


                The model used by this object is the following.  Given
                an input sequence x, predict an output label sequence y
                such that:
                    y == argmax_Y dot(get_weights(), PSI(x,Y))
                    Where PSI() is defined by the feature_extractor template
                    argument.  

            THREAD SAFETY
                It is always safe to use distinct instances of this object in different
                threads.  However, when a single instance is shared between threads then
                the following rules apply:
                    It is safe to call the const members of this object from multiple
                    threads so long as the feature_extractor is also threadsafe.  This is
                    because the const members are purely read-only operations.  However,
                    any operation that modifies a sequence_labeler is not threadsafe.
