              and it must contain objects which can be accepted by detector().
        ensures
            - Tests the given detector against the supplied object detection problem and
              returns the precision, recall, and average precision.  Note that the task is
              to predict, for each images[i], the set of object locations given by truth_dets[i].
            - In particular, returns a matrix M such that:  
                - M(0) == the precision of the detector object.  This is a number
                  in the range [0,1] which measures the fraction of detector outputs
                  which correspond to a real target.  A value of 1 means the detector
                  never produces any false alarms while a value of 0 means it only
                  produces false alarms.
                - M(1) == the recall of the detector object.  This is a number in the
                  range [0,1] which measures the fraction of targets found by the
                  detector.  A value of 1 means the detector found all the targets
                  in truth_dets while a value of 0 means the detector didn't locate
                  any of the targets.
                - M(2) == the average precision of the detector object.  This is a number
                  in the range [0,1] which measures the overall quality of the detector.
                  We compute this by taking all the detections output by the detector and
                  ordering them in descending order of their detection scores.  Then we use
                  the average_precision() routine to score the ranked listing and store the
                  output into M(2).
                - The rule for deciding if a detector output, D, matches a truth rectangle,
                  T, is the following:
                    T and R match if and only if: T.intersect(R).area()/(T+R).area() > overlap_eps
                - Note that you can use the adjust_threshold argument to raise or lower the
                  detection threshold.  This value is passed into the identically named
                  argument to the detector object and therefore influences the number of
                  output detections.  It can be useful, for example, to lower the detection
                  threshold because it results in more detections being output by the
                  detector, and therefore provides more information in the ranking,
                  possibly raising the average precision.
