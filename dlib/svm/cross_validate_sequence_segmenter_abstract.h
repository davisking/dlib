            - Tests segmenter against the given samples and truth segments and returns the
              precision, recall, and F1-score obtained by the segmenter.  That is, the goal
              of the segmenter should be to predict segments[i] given samples[i] as input.
              The test_sequence_segmenter() routine therefore measures how well the
              segmenter is able to perform this task.
            - Returns a row matrix M with the following properties:
                - M(0) == The precision of the segmenter measured against the task of
                  detecting the segments of each sample.  This is a number in the range 0
                  to 1 and represents the fraction of segments output by the segmenter
                  which correspond to true segments for each sample.
                - M(1) == The recall of the segmenter measured against the task of
                  detecting the segments of each sample.  This is a number in the range 0
                  to 1 and represents the fraction of the true segments found by the
                  segmenter. 
                - M(2) == The F1-score for the segmenter.  This is the harmonic mean of
                  M(0) and M(1).
