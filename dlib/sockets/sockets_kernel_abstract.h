        GENERAL COMMENTS:
            Nothing in here will throw exceptions.   
            
            All ip address strings in this file refer to IPv4 addresses.  For 
            example "192.168.1.1"

            Timeouts:
                All timeout values are measured in milliseconds but you are not 
                guaranteed to have that level of resolution.  The actual resolution
                is implementation defined.

            GENERAL WARNING
                Don't call any of these functions or make any of these objects

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object represents a TCP connection.

                Instances of this class can only be created by using the 
                create_connection function or listener class defined below.

                NOTE:  
                    A connection object must ALWAYS be closed (delete the pointer to the 
                    connection) or it will cause a resource leak.  

                    Note also that all errors indicated by a return code of OTHER_ERROR
                    are fatal so if one occurs the connection should just be closed.

            CLOSING A CONNECTION
                Note that if ~connection() or shutdown() is called before the remote client 
                has received all sent data it is possible that the data will be lost.  To 
                avoid this you should call the close_gracefully() function to close your 
                connections (unless you actually do want to immediately dispose of a 
                connection and don't care about the data).
                (example: close_gracefully(con); // close con gracefully but force it closed
                                                   // if it takes more than 500 milliseconds.)

            THREAD SAFETY
                - It is always safe to call shutdown() or shutdown_outgoing().   
                - you may NOT call any function more than once at a time (except the 
                  shutdown functions).
                - do not call read() more than once at a time
                - do not call write() more than once at a time
                - You can safely call shutdown or shutdown_outgoing in conjunction with 
                  the read/write functions.
                    This is helpful if you want to unblock another thread that is 
                    blocking on a read/write operation.  Shutting down the connection 
                    will cause the read/write functions to return a value of SHUTDOWN.

            OUT-OF-BAND DATA:
                All out-of-band data will be put inline into the normal data stream.
                This means that you can read any out-of-band data via calls to read(). 
                (i.e. the SO_OOBINLINE socket option will be set)
