    This example shows how to train a CNN based object detector using dlib's 
    loss_mmod loss layer.  This loss layer implements the Max-Margin Object
    Detection loss as described in the paper:
        Max-Margin Object Detection by Davis E. King (http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00046).
    This is the same loss used by the popular SVM+HOG object detector in dlib
    (see fhog_object_detector_ex.cpp) except here we replace the HOG features
    with a CNN and train the entire detector end-to-end.  This allows us to make
    much more powerful detectors.

    It would be a good idea to become familiar with dlib's DNN tooling before reading this
    example.  So you should read dnn_introduction_ex.cpp and dnn_introduction2_ex.cpp
    before reading this example program.  You should also read the introductory DNN+MMOD
    example dnn_mmod_ex.cpp as well before proceeding.
    

    This example is essentially a more complex version of dnn_mmod_ex.cpp.  In it we train
    a detector that finds the rear ends of motor vehicles.  I will also discuss some
    aspects of data preparation useful when training this kind of detector.

    // When I was creating the dlib vehicle detection dataset I had to label all the cars
    // in each image.  MMOD requires all cars to be labeled, since any unlabeled part of an
    // image is implicitly assumed to be not a car, and the algorithm will use it as
    // negative training data.  So every car must be labeled, either with a normal
    // rectangle or an "ignore" rectangle that tells MMOD to simply ignore it (i.e. neither
    // treat it as a thing to detect nor as negative training data).  
    // 
    // In our present case, many images contain very tiny cars in the distance, ones that
    // are essentially just dark smudges.  It's not reasonable to expect the CNN
    // architecture we defined to detect such vehicles.  However, I erred on the side of
    // having more complete annotations when creating the dataset.  So when I labeled these
    // images I labeled many of these really difficult cases as vehicles to detect.   
    //
    // So the first thing we are going to do is clean up our dataset a little bit.  In
    // particular, we are going to mark boxes smaller than 35*35 pixels as ignore since
    // only really small and blurry cars appear at those sizes.  We will also mark boxes
    // that are heavily overlapped by another box as ignore.  We do this because we want to
    // allow for stronger non-maximum suppression logic in the learned detector, since that
    // will help make it easier to learn a good detector. 
    // 
    // To explain this non-max suppression idea further it's important to understand how
    // the detector works.  Essentially, sliding window detectors scan all image locations
    // and ask "is there a care here?".  If there really is a car in a specific location in
    // an image then usually many slightly different sliding window locations will produce
    // high detection scores, indicating that there is a car at those locations.  If we
    // just stopped there then each car would produce multiple detections.  But that isn't
    // what we want.  We want each car to produce just one detection.  So it's common for
    // detectors to include "non-maximum suppression" logic which simply takes the
    // strongest detection and then deletes all detections "close to" the strongest.  This
    // is a simple post-processing step that can eliminate duplicate detections.  However,
    // we have to define what "close to" means.  We can do this by looking at your training
    // data and checking how close the closest target boxes are to each other, and then
    // picking a "close to" measure that doesn't suppress those target boxes but is
    // otherwise as tight as possible.  This is exactly what the mmod_options object does
    // by default.
    //
    // Importantly, this means that if your training dataset contains an image with two
    // target boxes that really overlap a whole lot, then the non-maximum suppression
    // "close to" measure will be configured to allow detections to really overlap a whole
    // lot.  On the other hand, if your dataset didn't contain any overlapped boxes at all,
    // then the non-max suppression logic would be configured to filter out any boxes that
    // overlapped at all, and thus would be performing a much stronger non-max suppression.  
    //
    // Why does this matter?  Well, remember that we want to avoid duplicate detections.
    // If non-max suppression just kills everything in a really wide area around a car then
    // the CNN doesn't really need to learn anything about avoiding duplicate detections.
    // However, if non-max suppression only suppresses a tiny area around each detection
    // then the CNN will need to learn to output small detection scores for those areas of
    // the image not suppressed.  The smaller the non-max suppression region the more the
    // CNN has to learn and the more difficult the learning problem will become.  This is
    // why we remove highly overlapped objects from the training dataset.  That is, we do
    // it so the non-max suppression logic will be able to be reasonably effective.  Here
    // we are ensuring that any boxes that are entirely contained by another are
    // suppressed.  We also ensure that boxes with an intersection over union of 0.5 or
    // greater are suppressed.  This will improve the resulting detector since it will be
    // able to use more aggressive non-max suppression settings.

            // 
            // For instance, if your dataset has boxes with an aspect ratio
            // of 10 then you should think about what that means for the network

            // labeling errors.  There are also a lot of datasets that aren't full of
            // errors, but are annotated in a sloppy and inconsistent way.  Fixing those
            // errors and inconsistencies can often greatly improve models trained from
            // such data.  It's almost always worth the time to try and improve your
            // training dataset.   
            //
            // In any case, my point is that there are other types of dataset cleaning you

    // Our vehicle detection dataset has basically 3 different types of boxes.  Square
    // boxes, tall and skinny boxes (e.g. semi trucks), and short and wide boxes (e.g.
    // sedans).  Here we are telling the MMOD algorithm that a vehicle is recognizable as
    // long as the longest box side is at least 70 pixels long and the shortest box side is
    // at least 30 pixels long.  mmod_options will use these parameters to decide how large
    // each of the sliding windows needs to be so as to be able to detect all the vehicles.
    // Since our dataset has basically these 3 different aspect ratios, it will decide to
    // use 3 different sliding windows.  This means the final con layer in the network will
    // have 3 filters, one for each of these aspect ratios. 
    //
    // Another thing to consider when setting the sliding window size is the "stride" of
    // your network.  The network we defined above downsamples the image by a factor of 8x
    // in the first few layers.  So when the sliding windows are scanning the image, they
    // are stepping over it with a stride of 8 pixels.  If you set the sliding window size
    // too small then the stride will become an issue.  For instance, if you set the
    // sliding window size to 4 pixels, then it means a 4x4 window will be moved by 8
    // pixels at a time when scanning. This is obviously a problem since 75% of the image
    // won't even be visited by the sliding window.  So you need to set the window size to
    // be big enough relative to the stride of your network.  In our case, the windows are
    // at least 30 pixels in length, so being moved by 8 pixel steps is fine. 
    mmod_options options(boxes_train, 70, 30);


    // This setting is very important and dataset specific.  The vehicle detection dataset
    // contains boxes that are marked as "ignore", as we discussed above.  Some of them are
    // ignored because we set ignore to true in the above code.  However, the xml files
    // also contained a lot of ignore boxes.  Some of them are large boxes that encompass
    // large parts of an image and the intention is to have everything inside those boxes
    // be ignored.  Therefore, we need to tell the MMOD algorithm to do that, which we do
    // by setting options.overlaps_ignore appropriately.  
    // 
    // But first, we need to understand exactly what this option does.  The MMOD loss
    // is essentially counting the number of false alarms + missed detections produced by
    // the detector for each image.  During training, the code is running the detector on
    // each image in a mini-batch and looking at its output and counting the number of
    // mistakes.  The optimizer tries to find parameters settings that minimize the number
    // of detector mistakes.
    // 
    // This overlaps_ignore option allows you to tell the loss that some outputs from the
    // detector should be totally ignored, as if they never happened.  In particular, if a
    // detection overlaps a box in the training data with ignore==true then that detection
    // is ignored.  This overlap is determined by calling
    // options.overlaps_ignore(the_detection, the_ignored_training_box).  If it returns
    // true then that detection is ignored.
    // 
    // You should read the documentation for test_box_overlap, the class type for
    // overlaps_ignore for full details.  However, the gist is that the default behavior is
    // to only consider boxes as overlapping if their intersection over union is > 0.5.
    // However, the dlib vehicle detection dataset contains large boxes that are meant to
    // mask out large areas of an image.  So intersection over union isn't an appropriate
    // way to measure "overlaps with box" in this case.  We want any box that is contained
    // inside one of these big regions to be ignored, even if the detection box is really
    // small.  So we set overlaps_ignore to behave that way with this line.
