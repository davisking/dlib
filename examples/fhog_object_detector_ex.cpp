    This example program shows how you can use dlib to make an object detector
    for things like faces, pedestrians, and any other semi-rigid object.  In
    particular, we go though the steps to train the kind of sliding window
    object detector first published by Dalal and Triggs in 2005 in the paper
    Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection.  

    Note that this program executes fastest when compiled with at least SSE2
    instructions enabled.  So if you are using a PC with an Intel or AMD chip
    then you should enable at least SSE2 instructions.  If you are using cmake
    to compile this program you can enable them by using one of the following
    commands when you create the build project:
        cmake path_to_dlib_root/examples -DUSE_SSE2_INSTRUCTIONS=ON
        cmake path_to_dlib_root/examples -DUSE_SSE4_INSTRUCTIONS=ON
        cmake path_to_dlib_root/examples -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=ON
    This will set the appropriate compiler options for GCC, clang, Visual
    Studio, or the Intel compiler.  If you are using another compiler then you
    need to consult your compiler's manual to determine how to enable these
    instructions.  Note that AVX is the fastest but requires a CPU from at least
    2011.  SSE4 is the next fastest and is supported by most current machines.

        // Now let's talk about some optional features of this training tool as well as some
        // important points you should understand.
        //
        // The first thing that should be pointed out is that, since this is a sliding
        // window classifier, it can't output an arbitrary rectangle as a detection.  In
        // this example our sliding window is 80 by 80 pixels and is run over an image
        // pyramid.  This means that it can only output detections that are at least 80 by
        // 80 pixels in size (recall that this is why we upsampled the images after loading
        // them).  It also means that the aspect ratio of the outputs is 1.  So if,
        // for example, you had a box in your training data that was 200 pixels by 10
        // pixels then it would simply be impossible for the detector to learn to detect
        // it.  Similarly, if you had a really small box it would be unable to learn to
        // detect it.  
        //
        // So the training code performs an input validation check on the training data and
        // will throw an exception if it detects any boxes that are impossible to detect
        // given your setting of scanning window size and image pyramid resolution.  You
        // can use a statement like:
        //   remove_unobtainable_rectangles(trainer, images_train, face_boxes_train)
        // to automatically discard these impossible boxes from your training dataset
        // before running the trainer.  This will avoid getting the "impossible box"
        // exception.  However, I would recommend you be careful that you are not throwing
        // away truth boxes you really care about.  The remove_unobtainable_rectangles()
        // will return the set of removed rectangles so you can visually inspect them and
        // make sure you are OK that they are being removed. 
        // 
        // Next, note that any location in the images not marked with a truth box is
        // implicitly treated as a negative example.  This means that when creating
        // training data it is critical that you label all the objects you want to detect.
        // So for example, if you are making a face detector then you must mark all the
        // faces in each image.  However, sometimes there are objects in images you are
        // unsure about or simply don't care if the detector identifies or not.  For these
        // objects you can pass in a set of "ignore boxes" as a third argument to the
        // trainer.train() function.  The trainer will simply disregard any detections that
        // happen to hit these boxes.  
        //
        // Another useful thing you can do is evaluate multiple HOG detectors together. The
        // benefit of this is increased testing speed since it avoids recomputing the HOG
        // features for each run of the detector.  You do this by storing your detectors
        // into a std::vector and then invoking evaluate_detectors() like so:
        std::vector<object_detector<image_scanner_type> > my_detectors;
        my_detectors.push_back(detector);
        std::vector<rectangle> dets = evaluate_detectors(my_detectors, images_train[0]); 
        //
        //
        // Finally, you can add a nuclear norm regularizer to the SVM trainer.  Doing has
        // two benefits.  First, it can cause the learned HOG detector to be composed of
        // separable filters and therefore makes it execute faster when detecting objects.
        // It can also help with generalization since it tends to make the learned HOG
        // filters smoother.  To enable this option you call the following function before
        // you create the trainer object:
        //    scanner.set_nuclear_norm_regularization_strength(1.0);
        // The argument determines how important it is to have a small nuclear norm.  A
        // bigger regularization strength means it is more important.  The smaller the
        // nuclear norm the smoother and faster the learned HOG filters will be, but if the
        // regularization strength value is too large then the SVM will not fit the data
        // well.  This is analogous to giving a C value that is too small.
        //
        // You can see how many separable filters are inside your detector like so:
        cout << "num filters: "<< num_separable_filters(detector) << endl;
        // You can also control how many filters there are by explicitly thresholding the
        // singular values of the filters like this:
        detector = threshold_filter_singular_values(detector,0.1);
        // That removes filter components with singular values less than 0.1.  The bigger
        // this number the fewer separable filters you will have and the faster the
        // detector will run.  However, a large enough threshold will hurt detection
        // accuracy.  

    }
    catch (exception& e)
    {
        cout << "\nexception thrown!" << endl;
        cout << e.what() << endl;
    }
}
