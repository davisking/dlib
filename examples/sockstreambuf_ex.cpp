    This is an example illustrating the use of the sockets,
    server and sockstreambuf components from the dlib C++ Library.

    This is a simple echo server.  It listens on port 1234 for incoming
    connections and just echos back any text it receives but in upper case.  
    So basically it is the same as the other sockets example except it 
    uses stream buffers.

    To test it out you can just open a command prompt and type:
    telnet localhost 1234

    Then you can type away.


    Also note that a good reference on the standard C++ iostream library can be 
    found at http://www.cplusplus.com/ref/iostream/

        // Now we make an iostream object that reads/writes to our streambuffer.  A lot of people
        // don't seem to know that the C++ iostreams are as powerful as they are.  So what I'm doing
