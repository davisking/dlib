    This is an example illustrating the use of the sockets and sockstreambuf
    components from the dlib C++ Library.  Note that there is also an
    iosockstream object in dlib that is often simpler to use, see
    iosockstream_ex.cpp for an example of its use.

    This program simply connects to www.google.com at port 80 and requests the
    main Google web page.  It then prints what it gets back from Google to the
    screen.

        // fails it will throw a dlib::socket_error exception.  Note that we
        // are using a smart pointer here to contain the connection pointer

        // a proper TCP shutdown by sending a FIN packet to the other end of the

        // connection as well.  If half a second goes by without the other end 
        // responding then the connection is forcefully shutdown and deleted.  
        // 
        // You usually want to perform a graceful shutdown of your TCP connections 
        // because there might be some data you tried to send that is still buffered 
        // in the operating system's output buffers.  If you just killed the 
        // connection it might not be sent to the other side (although maybe 
        // you don't care, and in the case of this example it doesn't really matter.  
        // But I'm only putting this here for the purpose of illustration :-).  
        // In any case, this function is provided to allow you to perform a graceful 
        // close if you so choose.  
        // 
        // Also note that the timeout can be changed by suppling an optional argument 
        // to this function.
