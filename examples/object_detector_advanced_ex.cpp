    This is an example illustrating the process for defining custom
    bag-of-visual-word style feature extractors for use with the
    structural_object_detection_trainer.

    NOTICE: This example assumes you are familiar with the contents of the
    object_detector_ex.cpp example program.  Also, if the objects you want to
    detect are somewhat rigid in appearance (e.g.  faces, pedestrians, etc.)
    then you should try the methods shown in the fhog_object_detector_ex.cpp
    example program before trying to use the bag-of-visual-word tools shown in
    this example.

        WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
            This object is a feature extractor which goes to every pixel in an image and
            produces a 32 dimensional feature vector.  This vector is an indicator vector
            which records the pattern of pixel values in a 4-connected region.  So it should
            be able to distinguish basic things like whether or not a location falls on the
            corner of a white box, on an edge, in the middle, etc.


            Note that this object also implements the interface defined in dlib/image_keypoint/hashed_feature_image_abstract.h.
            This means all the member functions in this object are supposed to behave as 
            described in the hashed_feature_image specification.  So when you define your own
            feature extractor objects you should probably refer yourself to that documentation
            in addition to reading this example program.
