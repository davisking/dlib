    This is an example illustrating the use of the tools in dlib for doing distribution
    estimation or detecting anomalies using one-class support vector machines. 

    Unlike regular classifiers, these tools take unlabeled points and try to learn what
    parts of the feature space normally contain data samples and which do not.  Typically
    you use these tools when you are interested in finding outliers or otherwise
    identifying "unusual" data samples.

    In this example, we will sample points from the sinc() function to generate our set of
    "typical looking" points.  Then we will train some one-class classifiers and use them
    to predict if new points are unusual or not.  In this case, unusual means a point is
    not from the sinc() curve.

    // It should be noted that the svm_one_class_trainer becomes very slow when you have
    // more than 10 or 20 thousand training points.  However, dlib comes with very fast SVM
    // tools which you can use instead at the cost of a little more setup.  In particular,
    // it is possible to use one of dlib's very fast linear SVM solvers to train a one
    // class SVM.  This is what we do below.  We will train on 115,000 points and it only
    // takes a few seconds with this tool!
    // 
    // The first step is constructing a feature space that is appropriate for use with a
    // linear SVM.  In general, this is quite problem dependent.  However, if you have
    // under about a hundred dimensions in your vectors then it can often be quite
    // effective to use the empirical_kernel_map as we do below (see the
    // empirical_kernel_map documentation and example program for an extended discussion of
    // what it does).  
    //
    // But putting the empirical_kernel_map aside, the most important step in turning a
    // linear SVM into a one-class SVM is the following.  We append a -1 value onto the end
    // of each feature vector and then tell the trainer to force the weight for this
    // feature to 1.  This means that if the linear SVM assigned all other weights a value
    // of 0 then the output from a learned decision function would always be -1.  The
    // second step is that we ask the SVM to label each training sample with +1.  This
    // causes the SVM to set the other feature weights such that the training samples have
    // positive outputs from the learned decision function.  But the starting bias for all
    // the points in the whole feature space is -1.  The result is that points outside our
    // training set will not be affected, so their outputs from the decision function will
    // remain close to -1.
