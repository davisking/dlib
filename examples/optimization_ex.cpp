    This is an example illustrating the use the general purpose non-linear 
    optimization routines from the dlib C++ Library.

    The library provides implementations of the conjugate gradient,  BFGS,
    L-BFGS, and BOBYQA optimization algorithms.  These algorithms allow you to
    find the minimum of a function of many input variables.  This example walks
    though a few of the ways you might put these routines to use.

        This object is an example of what is known as a "function object" in C++.
        It is simply an object with an overloaded operator().  This means it can 
        be used in a way that is similar to a normal C function.  The interesting
        thing about this sort of function is that it can have state.  
        
        In this example, our test_function object contains a column_vector 
        as its state and it computes the mean squared error between this 
        stored column_vector and the arguments to its operator() function.

        This is a very simple function, however, in general you could compute
        any function you wanted here.  An example of a typical use would be 
        to find the parameters of some regression function that minimized 
        the mean squared error on a set of data.  In this case the arguments
        to the operator() function would be the parameters of your regression
        function.  You would loop over all your data samples and compute the output 
        of the regression function for each data sample given the parameters and 
        return a measure of the total error.   The dlib optimization functions 
        could then be used to find the parameters that minimized the error.
