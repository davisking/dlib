    This is an example illustrating the use of the structural SVM solver from the dlib C++
    Library.  Therefore, this example teaches you the central ideas needed to setup a
    structural SVM model for your machine learning problems.  To illustrate the process, we
    use dlib's structural SVM solver to learn the parameters of a simple multi-class
    classifier.  We first discuss the multi-class classifier model and then walk through
    using the structural SVM tools to find the parameters of this classification model.

// second is used to represent the "sample type".  In this example program it is just a
// vector but in general when using a structural SVM your sample type can be anything you
// want (e.g. a string or an image).  The last typedef is the type used to represent the
// PSI vector which is part of the structural SVM model which we will explain in detail
// later on.  But the important thing to note here is that you can use either a dense
// representation (i.e. a dlib::matrix object) or a sparse representation for the PSI
// vector.  See svm_sparse_ex.cpp for an introduction to sparse vectors in dlib.  Here we
// use the same type for each of these three things to keep the example program simple.

        Now we arrive at the meat of this example program.  To use dlib's structural SVM
        solver you need to define an object which tells the structural SVM solver what to
        do for your problem.  In this example, this is done by defining the three_class_classifier_problem 
        object which inherits from structural_svm_problem_threaded.  Before we get into the
        details, we first discuss some background information on structural SVMs.  
        
        A structural SVM is a supervised machine learning method for learning to predict
        complex outputs.  This is contrasted with a binary classifier which makes only simple
        yes/no predictions.  A structural SVM, on the other hand, can learn to predict
        complex outputs such as entire parse trees or DNA sequence alignments.  To do this,
        it learns a function F(x,y) which measures how well a particular data sample x
        matches a label y, where a label is potentially a complex thing like a parse tree.
        However, to keep this example program simple we use only a 3 category label output. 
       
        At test time, the best label for a new x is given by the y which maximizes F(x,y).
        To put this into the context of the current example, F(x,y) computes the score for
        a given sample and class label.  The predicted class label is therefore whatever
        value of y which makes F(x,y) the biggest.  This is exactly what predict_label()
        does.  That is, it computes F(x,0), F(x,1), and F(x,2) and then reports which label
        has the biggest value.
       
        At a high level, a structural SVM can be thought of as searching the parameter space
        of F(x,y) for the set of parameters that make the following inequality true as often
        as possible:
            F(x_i,y_i) > max{over all incorrect labels of x_i} F(x_i, y_incorrect)
        That is, it seeks to find the parameter vector such that F(x,y) always gives the
        highest score to the correct output.  To define the structural SVM optimization
        problem precisely, we first introduce some notation:
            - let PSI(x,y)    == the joint feature vector for input x and a label y.
            - let F(x,y|w)    == dot(w,PSI(x,y)).  
              (we use the | notation to emphasize that F() has the parameter vector of
              weights called w)
            - let LOSS(idx,y) == the loss incurred for predicting that the idx-th training 
              sample has a label of y.  Note that LOSS() should always be >= 0 and should
              become exactly 0 when y is the correct label for the idx-th sample.  Moreover,
              it should notionally indicate how bad it is to predict y for the idx'th sample.
            - let x_i == the i-th training sample.
            - let y_i == the correct label for the i-th training sample.
            - The number of data samples is N.
       
        Then the optimization problem solved by dlib's structural SVM solver is the following:
            Minimize: h(w) == 0.5*dot(w,w) + C*R(w)
       
            Where R(w) == sum from i=1 to N: 1/N * sample_risk(i,w)
            and sample_risk(i,w) == max over all Y: LOSS(i,Y) + F(x_i,Y|w) - F(x_i,y_i|w)
            and C > 0
       
        You can think of the sample_risk(i,w) as measuring the degree of error you would make
        when predicting the label of the i-th sample using parameters w.  That is, it is zero
        only when the correct label would be predicted and grows larger the more "wrong" the
        predicted output becomes.  Therefore, the objective function is minimizing a balance
        between making the weights small (typically this reduces overfitting) and fitting the
        training data.  The degree to which you try to fit the data is controlled by the C
        parameter.
       
        For a more detailed introduction to structured support vector machines you should
        consult the following paper:

    // Finally, we come back to the code.  To use dlib's structural SVM solver you need to
    // provide the things discussed above.  This is the number of training samples, the

    // PSI() vectors.  You will also need to write code that can compute: max over all Y:

        // example program, and putting it into one of 3 places in a 9 dimensional PSI
        // vector, which we then return.  So this function returns PSI(x,label).  To see why
        // we setup PSI like this, recall how predict_label() works.  It takes in a 9
        // dimensional weight vector and breaks the vector into 3 pieces.  Each piece then
        // defines a different classifier and we use them in a one-vs-all manner to predict
        // the label.  So now that we are in the structural SVM code we have to define the
        // PSI vector to correspond to this usage.  That is, we need to setup PSI so that
        // argmax_y dot(weights,PSI(x,y)) == predict_label(weights,x).  This is how we tell
        // the structural SVM solver what kind of problem we are trying to solve.

        // It's worth emphasizing that the single biggest step in using a structural SVM is

        // finding the max scoring label turns into a difficult combinatorial optimization
        // problem.  So you need to pick a PSI that doesn't make the label maximization step
        // intractable but also still well models your problem.
