    This is an example illustrating the use of the kernel ridge regression 
    object from the dlib C++ Library.  

    This example creates a simple set of data to train on and then shows
    you how to use the kernel ridge regression tool to find a good decision 
    function that can classify examples in our data set.


    The data used in this example will be 2 dimensional data and will
    come from a distribution where points with a distance less than 13
    from the origin are labeled +1 and all other points are labeled
    as -1.  All together, the dataset will contain 10201 sample points.
