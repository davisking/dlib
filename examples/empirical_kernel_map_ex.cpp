    This is an example illustrating the use of the empirical_kernel_map 
    from the dlib C++ Library.

    This example program assumes you are familiar with some general elements of 
    the library.  In particular, you should have at least read the svm_ex.cpp 
    and matrix_ex.cpp examples.   


    Most of the machine learning algorithms in dlib are some flavor of "kernel machine".
    This means they are all simple linear algorithms that have been formulated such 
    that the only way they look at the data given by a user is via dot products between
    the data samples.  These algorithms are made more useful via the application of the
    so-called kernel trick.  This trick is to replace the dot product with a user 
    supplied function which takes two samples and returns a real number.  This function 
    is the kernel that is required by so many algorithms.  The most basic kernel is the 
    linear_kernel which is simply a normal dot product.  More interesting, however,
    are kernels which first apply some nonlinear transformation to the user's data samples 
    and then compute a dot product.  In this way, a simple algorithm that finds a linear
    plane to separate data (e.g. the SVM algorithm) can be made to solve complex 
    nonlinear learning problems.  
    
    An important element of the kernel trick is that these kernel functions perform 
    the nonlinear transformation implicitly.  That is, if you look at the implementations
    of these kernel functions you won't see code that transforms two input vectors in 
    some way and then computes their dot products.  Instead you will see a simple function
    that takes two input vectors and just computes a single real number via some simple
    process.  You can basically think of this as an optimization.  Imagine that originally 
    we wrote out the entire procedure to perform the nonlinear transformation and then
    compute the dot product but then noticed we could cancel a few terms here and there 
    and simplify the whole thing down into a more compact and easily evaluated form.
    The result is a nice function that computes what we want but we no longer get to see
    what those nonlinearly transformed input vectors are.  

    The empirical_kernel_map is a tool that undoes this.  It allows you to obtain these 
    nonlinearly transformed vectors.  It does this by taking a set of data samples from 
    the user (referred to as basis samples), applying the nonlinear transformation to all 
    of them, and then constructing a set of orthonormal basis vectors which spans the space 
    occupied by those transformed input samples.  Then if we wish to obtain the nonlinear 
    version of any data sample we can simply project it onto this orthonormal basis and 
    we obtain a regular vector of real numbers which represents the nonlinearly transformed 
    version of the data sample.  The empirical_kernel_map has been formulated to use only 
    dot products between data samples so it is capable of performing this service for any 
    user supplied kernel function. 
    
    The empirical_kernel_map is useful because it is often difficult to formulate an 
    algorithm in a way that uses only dot products.  So the empirical_kernel_map lets 
    us easily kernelize any algorithm we like by using this object during a preprocessing 
    step.  However, it should be noted that the algorithm is only practical when used 
    with at most a few thousand basis samples.  Fortunately, most datasets live in 
    subspaces that are relatively low dimensional.  So for these datasets, using the 
    empirical_kernel_map is practical assuming an appropriate set of basis samples can be 
    selected by the user.  To help with this dlib supplies the linearly_independent_subset_finder.  
    I also often find that just picking a random subset of the data as a basis works well.



    In what follows, we walk through the process of creating an empirical_kernel_map,
    projecting data to obtain the nonlinearly transformed vectors, and then doing a 
    few interesting things with the data.

        Note that if we use enough basis samples we can perfectly span the space of input samples.
        In that case we get errors that are essentially just rounding noise (Moreover, using all the 
        samples is always enough since they are always within their own span).  Once we start 
        to use fewer basis samples we may begin to get approximation error.  In the second case we 
        used 26 and we can see that the data doesn't really lay exactly in a 26 dimensional subspace.  
        But it is pretty close.
