    This is an example illustrating the use of the kkmeans object 
    from the dlib C++ Library.

    The kkmeans object is an implementation of a kernelized k-means clustering 
    algorithm.  It is implemented by using the kcentroid object to represent 
    each center found by the usual k-means clustering algorithm.  

    So this object allows you to perform non-linear clustering in the same way 
    a svm classifier finds non-linear decision surfaces.  
    
    This example will make points from 3 classes and perform kernelized k-means 
    clustering on those points.

    The classes are as follows:
        - points very close to the origin
        - points on the circle of radius 10 around the origin
        - points that are on a circle of radius 4 but not around the origin at all

    // give better results but cause the algorithm to attempt to use more dictionary vectors
