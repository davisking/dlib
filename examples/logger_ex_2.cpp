    This is a somewhat complex example illustrating the use of the logger object 
    from the dlib C++ Library.  It will demonstrate using multiple loggers and threads.  


    The output of this program looks like this:
    0 INFO  [0] example: This is an informational message.
    0 WARN  [0] example: The variable is bigger than 4!  Its value is 8
    0 INFO  [0] example: make two threads
    0 WARN  [0] example.test_class: warning!  someone called warning()!
    0 INFO  [0] example: we are going to sleep for half a second.
    0 INFO  [1] example.thread: entering our thread
    0 WARN  [1] example.test_class: warning!  someone called warning()!
    0 INFO  [2] example.thread: entering our thread
    0 WARN  [2] example.test_class: warning!  someone called warning()!
  203 INFO  [1] example.thread: exiting our thread
  203 INFO  [2] example.thread: exiting our thread
  503 INFO  [0] example: we just woke up
  503 INFO  [0] example: program ending

    Here we create three loggers.  Note that it is the case that:
        - logp.is_child_of(logp) == true
        - logt.is_child_of(logp) == true
        - logc.is_child_of(logp) == true

    logp is the child of itself because all loggers are their own children :)  But the other
    two are child loggers of logp because their names start with logp.name() + "." which means
    that whenever you set a property on a log it will also set that same property on all of
    the log's children.

    // this example program but if you had loggers defined in other files then you might not have
    // easy access to them when starting up your program and setting log levels.  This mechanism
    // allows you to manipulate the properties of any logger so long as you know its name.
    logger temp_log("example");

    // For this example I don't want to log debug messages so I'm setting the logging level of 
    // All our loggers to LINFO.  Note that this statement sets all three of our loggers to this
    // logging level because they are all children of temp_log.   
    temp_log.set_level(LINFO);


    // In addition I only want the example.test_class to print LWARN or higher messages so I'm going
    // to set that here too.  Note that we set this value after calling temp_log.set_level(). If we 
    // did it the other way around the set_level() call on temp_log would set logc_temp.level() and 
    // logc.level() back to LINFO since temp_log is a parent of logc_temp.

    // It is also worth pointing out that the logger messages are atomic.  This means, for example, that
    // in the above log statements that involve a string literal and a variable, no other thread can
    // come in and print a log message in-between the literal string and the variable.  This is good
    // because it means your messages don't get corrupted.  However, this also means that you shouldn't 
    // make any function calls inside a logging statement if those calls might try to log a message 
    // themselves since the atomic nature of the logger would cause your application to deadlock.
