    This is an example that shows some reasonable ways you can perform
    model selection with the dlib C++ Library.  

    It will create a simple set of data and then show you how to use 
    the cross validation and optimization routines to determine good model 
    parameters for the purpose of training an svm to classify the sample data.

    The data used in this example will be 2 dimensional data and will
    come from a distribution where points with a distance less than 10
    from the origin are labeled +1 and all other points are labeled
    as -1.
        

    As an side, you should probably read the svm_ex.cpp and matrix_ex.cpp example 
    programs before you read this one.
