    This is an example illustrating the use of the Hough transform tool in the
    dlib C++ Library.


    In this example we are going to draw a line on an image and then use the
    Hough transform to detect the location of the line.  Moreover, we do this in
    a loop that changes the line's position slightly each iteration, which gives
    a pretty animation of the Hough transform in action.

        // overlaps the original line.
