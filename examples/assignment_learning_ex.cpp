    This is an example illustrating the use of the dlib machine learning tools for 
    learning to solve the assignment problem. 
    
    Many tasks in computer vision or natural language processing can be thought of 
    as assignment problems.  For example, in a computer vision application where 
    you are trying to track objects moving around in video, you likely need to solve
    an association problem every time you get a new video frame.  That is, each new 
    frame will contain objects (e.g. people, cars, etc.) and you will want to 
    determine which of these objects are actually things you have seen in previous 
    frames.  
   
    The assignment problem can be optimally solved using the well known Hungarian 
    algorithm.  However, this algorithm requires the user to supply some function 
    which measures the "goodness" of an individual association.  In many cases the 
    best way to measure this goodness isn't obvious and therefore machine learning 
    methods are used.  
    
    The remainder of this example program will show you how to learn a goodness 
    function which is optimal, in a certain sense, for use with the Hungarian 
    algorithm.  To do this, we will make a simple dataset of example associations 
    and use them to train a supervised machine learning method.

/*
    In an association problem, we will talk about the "Left Hand Set" (LHS) and the
    "Right Hand Set" (RHS).  The task will be to learn to map all elements of LHS to 
    unique elements of RHS.  If an element of LHS can't be mapped to a unique element of 
    RHS for some reason (e.g. LHS is bigger than RHS) then it can also be mapped to the 
    special -1 output, indicating no mapping to RHS.

    So the first step is to define the type of elements in each of these sets.  In the
    code below we will use column vectors in both LHS and RHS.  However, in general,
    they can each contain any type you like.  LHS can even contain a different type 
    than RHS.
