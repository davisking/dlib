    detecting objects in images.  In this example we will create
    three simple images, each containing some white squares.  We
    will then use the sliding window classifier tools to learn to

            This next block of code specifies the type of sliding window classifier we will
            be using to detect the white squares.  The most important thing here is the
            scan_image_pyramid template.  Instances of this template represent the core
            of a sliding window classifier.  To go into more detail, the sliding window 
            classifiers used by this object have three parts: 
                   1. The underlying feature extraction.  See the dlib documentation for a detailed 
                      discussion of how the hashed_feature_image and hog_image feature extractors
                      work.  However, to understand this example, all you need to know is that the 
                      feature extractor associates a vector with each location in an image.  This 
                      vector is supposed to capture information which describes how parts of the 
                      image look.  Importantly, it should do this in a way that is relevant to the 
                      problem you are trying to solve.

                   2. A detection template.  This is a rectangle which defines the shape of a 
                      sliding window (i.e. the object_box), as well as a set of rectangular feature 
                      extraction regions inside it.  This set of regions defines the spatial 
                      structure of the overall feature extraction within a sliding window.  In 
                      particular, each location of a sliding window has a feature vector 
                      associated with it.  This feature vector is defined as follows:
                        - Let N denote the number of feature extraction zones.
                        - Let M denote the dimensionality of the vectors output by Feature_extractor_type
                          objects.
                        - Let F(i) == the M dimensional vector which is the sum of all vectors 
                          given by our Feature_extractor_type object inside the ith feature extraction
                          zone.
                        - Then the feature vector for a sliding window is an M*N dimensional vector
                          [F(1) F(2) F(3) ... F(N)] (i.e. it is a concatenation of the N vectors).
                          This feature vector can be thought of as a collection of N "bags of features",
                          each bag coming from a spatial location determined by one of the rectangular
                          feature extraction zones.
                          
                   3. A weight vector and a threshold value.  The dot product between the weight
                      vector and the feature vector for a sliding window location gives the score 
                      of the window.  If this score is greater than the threshold value then the 
                      window location is output as a detection.  You don't need to determine these
                      parameters yourself.  They are automatically populated by the 
                      structural_object_detection_trainer.

                The sliding window classifiers described above are applied to every level of an
                image pyramid.  So you need to tell scan_image_pyramid what kind of pyramid you want
                to use.  In this case we are using pyramid_down<2> which downsamples each pyramid
                layer by half (if you want to use a finer image pyramid then just change the
                template argument to a larger value.  For example, using pyramid_down<5> would
                downsample each layer by a ratio of 5 to 4).

                Finally, some of the feature extraction zones are allowed to move freely within the
                object box.  This means that when we are sliding the classifier over an image, some
                feature extraction zones are stationary (i.e. always in the same place relative to
                the object box) while others are allowed to move anywhere within the object box.  In
                particular, the movable regions are placed at the locations that maximize the score
                of the classifier.  Note further that each of the movable feature extraction zones
                must pass a threshold test for it to be included.  That is, if the score that a
                movable zone would contribute to the overall score for a sliding window location is
                not positive then that zone is not included in the feature vector (i.e. its part of
                the feature vector is set to zero.  This way the length of the feature vector stays
                constant).  This movable region construction allows us to represent objects with
                parts that move around relative to the object box.  For example, a human has hands
                but they aren't always in the same place relative to a person's bounding box.
                However, to keep this example program simple, we will only be using stationary
                feature extraction regions.
