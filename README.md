# dlib C++ library [![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/davisking/dlib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davisking/dlib)

Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. See [http://dlib.net](http://dlib.net) for the main project documentation and API reference.

Some common questions are answered in [FAQ](http://dlib.net/faq.html). The best way to get support is using [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dlib).

## Installing dlib as a shared library into your system

Dlib is designed to be compiled with [CMake](https://cmake.org/). After cloning dlib from git or downloading it's sources, go into dlib folder and type:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
cmake --build . --target install
```

On some Linux systems last command should be run as `sudo` to get access to /usr/local folder:
```
sudo cmake --build . --target install
```

## Using dlib in your project
After dlib is installed in your system, you can now use it with CMake like this:
```CMake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.4)
find_package(dlib REQUIRED)

include_directories(${dlib_INCLUDE_DIRS})
link_directories(${DLIB_LIBRARY_DIRS})

add_executable(dlibsample dlibsample.cpp)
target_link_libraries(dlibsample ${dlib_LIBRARIES})
```

Some additional ways to compile and use dlib are described in [Documentation](http://dlib.net/compile.html)

## Compiling dlib C++ example programs

Go into the examples folder and type:

```bash
mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. ; cmake --build .
```

That will build all the examples.
If you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions then turn them on like this:

```bash
mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=1; cmake --build .
```

Doing so will make some things run faster.

## Compiling your own C++ programs that use dlib

The examples folder has a [CMake tutorial](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/examples/CMakeLists.txt) that tells you what to do.  There are also additional instructions on the [dlib web site](http://dlib.net/compile.html).

## Compiling dlib Python API

Before you can run the Python example programs you must compile dlib. Type:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

or type

```bash
python setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS
```

if you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions, since this makes some things run faster.  Note that you need to have boost-python installed to compile the Python API.



## Running the unit test suite

Type the following to compile and run the dlib unit test suite:

```bash
cd dlib/test
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
./dtest --runall
```

Note that on windows your compiler might put the test executable in a subfolder called `Release`. If that's the case then you have to go to that folder before running the test.
