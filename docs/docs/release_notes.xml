<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.19" date="Dec 14, 2019">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Made find_min_global() and find_max_global() much faster when using them
     to optimize inexpensive functions.  These tools now measure the runtime of
     the objective function and automatically tune themselves to balance solver
     overhead vs objective function execution time.
   - Improved handling of label and ignore boxes in loss_mmod layer.
     See here for more details: https://github.com/davisking/dlib/issues/1894
   - Better auto-detection of build configurations on some platforms.
   - Shiny new deep instance segmentation examples:
     dnn_instance_segmentation_ex.cpp and dnn_instance_segmentation_train_ex.cpp.  

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Fix build error in some versions of visual studio in some setups.
   - Fix find_max() going into an infinite loop in some cases when a
     non-differentiable function is given.

</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.18" date="Sep 22, 2019">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Make dlib.full_object_detection take list of dlib.point or dlib.points.
   - CMake scripts will automatically include the Intel MKL's iomp dll in the
     output folder to reduce confusion for windows users who haven't added the
     Intel MKL to their PATH.  This avoids a dll not found error that would
     otherwise result in that situation.
   - load_jpeg() now supports loading from a memory buffer.
   - Added input_grayscale_image_pyramid DNN input layer.
   - Added loss_mean_squared_per_channel DNN input layer.
   - Added methods for getting keyboard and mouse clicks to image_window's python API.
   - Made pkg-config report all needed include and link settings to use dlib.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Setting a point's y coordinate changed x instead, when done from Python.
     This has been fixed.
   - Fixed global_function_search's initialization being wrong if explicitly
     given an empty list of initial function evaluations.
   - Fixed compile time errors on some uncommon system configurations.
   - Work around bugs in CUDA runtime on some systems.
   - Various improvements to CMake built scripts to handle unusual system configurations.
   - Fixed bug in multi-GPU training of semantic segmentation models.

</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.17" date="Mar 10, 2019">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Added weighted labels to loss_binary_log layer.
   - Added padding option to Python compute_face_descriptor() methods.
   - Added pointwise_divide function.
   - Added U-net style skip connections to the semantic-segmentation example.
   - Exposed dlib::chinese_whispers() directly in Python API.
   - Added python api that generates desciptor(s) from the aligned image(s).
   - Added support for CUDA 10.1.
   - Dlib's python install process always automatically enables all supported features.  
     So --yes &lt;option&gt; was removed as it does nothing.
   - Added --box-images to imglab.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed build errors on some systems or buggy compilers.
   - Workaround for bug in cudaStreamSynchronize() causing hanging in some rare cases.
   - Fixed broken CUDA memcpy overload.
   - Fixed CMake not finding cusolver in CUDA 10.1. 

</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.16" date="Sep 29, 2018">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Allow 64bit seeds for murmur hash.
   - Some code paths are a little faster.
   - Added an option to do bounding box regression to the loss_mmod layer.
   - Added resize_image(img,scale) to Python API.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed build errors in some environments.
   - Make older versions of CMake work with CUDA 10.
   - Fixed is_image_type template always reporting false. This also caused
     have_same_dimensions() to be uncallable for images, so that's fixed now too.

</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.15" date="Jul 13, 2018">
New Features and Improvements:

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed sub_image() in the Python API not working correctly for non-8bit images.
   - Last release broke have_same_dimensions(). The version specific to images
     was being used for tensors, which is incorrect and caused some of the DNN
     tooling to malfunction.

</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.14" date="Jul 07, 2018">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Added a --split-train-test option to imglab.
   - Added a max runtime option to the oca solver and structural object
     detection trainer.
   - Added an option to do translational jittering of the bounding boxes in the
     shape_predictor_trainer.  Using this option allows you to train
     shape_predictors that are somewhat more robust against variation in
     detection box placement. 
   - Added an optional thread_pool argument to find_max_global() and
     find_min_global() to allow for parallel execution of objective function calls.
   - Added auto_train_rbf_classifier(), a tool that trains a RBF-SVM without requiring the user
     to supply any hyperparameters.
   - Added polygon_area()
   - The image view objects now implement the generic image interface.
   - Updates to the Python API:
       - Added Python bindings for: extract_image_chip(),
         extract_image_chips(), center(), get_histogram(), sub_image(),
         polygon_area(), auto_train_rbf_classifier(), reduced(),
         translate_rect(), spatially_filter_image(),
         spatially_filter_image_separable(), num_separable_filters(),
         threshold_filter_singular_values(), max_point(),
         max_point_interpolated(), zero_border_pixels().  Also added an option
         for training nuclear norm regularized HOG detectors.
       - Added a bunch of new overloads and operators for existing Python types.
       - Made decision functions more viewable from python.  You can now inspect
         the contents of the functions rather than them being completely opaque.
       - Made it so you can call the std::vector&lt;detectors&gt; version of
         the object_detector constructor from python. So now you can pack
         multiple detectors into one object via the python API.
       - Allow batched face recognition for greater performance.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed the point and dpoint operator + doing subtraction in the Python API.
   - Fixed label_connected_blobs_watershed() not giving contiguous labels as outputs. 
   - Fixed AVX detection not working correctly on some systems.
   - Fixed dlib.threshold_image() ignoring the optional thresh argument in the Python API.
   - Fixed hough_transform::find_pixels_voting_for_lines(). It would sometimes
     include a pixel multiple times in the output lists.
   - Made the routines that rotate image datasets use the rectangle_transform
     instead of the bad old way that only really worked for square boxes.  This
     improves placement of such rotated rectangular boxes.

</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.13" date="May 26, 2018">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Added a lot of new Python bindings.  You can now use these things from Python:
      - gaussian_blur(), label_connected_blobs(), randomly_color_image(), jet(),
        skeleton(), find_line_endpoints(), get_rect(), shrink_rect(), grow_rect(),
        image_gradients, label_connected_blobs_watershed(), convert_image(),
        convert_image_scaled(), dpoint, centered_rect(), centered_rects(), length(),
        as_grayscale(), pyramid_down, find_bright_keypoints(), find_bright_lines(),
        find_dark_lines(), find_dark_keypoints(), suppress_non_maximum_edges(),
        find_peaks(), hysteresis_threshold(), sobel_edge_detector(), equalize_histogram(),
        resize_image(), hough_transform, remove_incoherent_edge_pixels(),
        normalize_image_gradients(), line, signed_distance_to_line(), distance_to_line(),
        reverse(), intersect(), count_points_on_side_of_line(),
        count_points_between_lines(), dot(), normalize(), point_transform_projective,
        find_projective_transform(), inv(), transform_image(), angle_between_lines(),
        extract_image_4points(), load_grayscale_image(), min_barrier_distance(). 
      - Added a .add_overlay_circle() to dlib.image_window.  Also made .add_overlay()
        take lines.
      - Added the *_corner() routines to rectangle and drectangle and made these 
        objects constructable from instances of each other.
   - Made the Python extension module automatically enable AVX instructions if the host
     machine supports them.  So you never need to say --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS anymore
     when installing dlib.

   - New C++ routines:
      - Added an image_window::add_overlay() overload for line object.
      - Added angle_between_lines()
      - Added extract_image_4points()
      - Added is_convex_quadrilateral(), find_convex_quadrilateral(), and no_convex_quadrilateral.
      - Added python_list_to_array()
      - Added min_barrier_distance() 

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed numpy_image and pybind11 crashing python sometimes when certain types of
     conversions are attempted.
   - Fixed some python functions not taking as wide a range of image types as they did in
     previous dlib versions.
</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.12" date="May 19, 2018">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Added Python interface to threshold_image() and partition_pixels().

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - In the Python API, renamed dlib.save_rgb_image() to dlib.save_image().

Bug fixes:
   - Dlib 19.11 had a bug that caused the Python interface to reject grayscale images.
     This has been fixed.
</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.11" date="May 17, 2018">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Deep Learning
      - Added resize_to layer.
      - Made loss_multiclass_log_per_pixel use CUDA. This greatly accelerates 
        training with this loss layer.
   - Image Processing
      - Added normalize_image_gradients() and remove_incoherent_edge_pixels().
      - Added neighbors_24 (for use with label_connected_blobs())
      - Added partition_pixels() and made threshold_image() use it to find the
        default threshold if none is given. Also depreciated
        auto_threshold_image() since using partition_pixels() to pick the
        threshold is superior.
      - Added overload of hysteresis_threshold() that uses partition_pixels()
        to select thresholds.
      - Added encode_8_pixel_neighbors() and find_line_endpoints().
      - Added image_gradients, a tool for computing multi-scale first and
        second order image gradients. 
      - Added find_bright_lines(), find_dark_lines(), find_bright_keypoints(),
        and find_dark_keypoints(). 
      - Added label_connected_blobs_watershed().
      - Added find_peaks().
      - Added find_pixels_voting_for_lines(), find_strong_hough_points(),
        and perform_generic_hough_transform() to the hough_transform.
   - Improved the stopping condition of the solve_qp_box_constrained() and
     solve_qp_box_constrained_blockdiag() quadratic program solvers.
   - Made find_min_single_variable() more numerically stable.
   - Make visual studio build with all cores when building dlib.
   - Added steal_memory() to the matrix.
   - Improved the workflow for adding part annotations in imglab.  You can now
     use shift+click to rapidly add parts to an object.  Each part will
     automatically receive an integer label.
   - Added .begin() and .end() to array2d.
   - Added the line class and some related utility functions.
   - Added centered_rects().
   - Added numpy_image, which is a simple type safe interface to numpy arrays.
     It is also a fully functional dlib image class, making interfacing dlib's
     image processing to Python much cleaner.  

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - All CUDA code in dlib was moved to dlib/cuda.

Bug fixes:
   - Replaced all the old Python C APIs interfacing to numpy with the new
     numpy_image.  This fixed some reference counting errors as a result.
   - Fixed load_bmp() not loading certain types of BMP images. 
   - Fixed compile time bugs when trying to use CBLAS in some unusual environments.
   - Fixed bug in global_function_search's constructor that takes initial function
     evaluations. It wasn't assigning these values into the entire state of the
     solver.
   - Fixed compile time error in the matlab bindings.  Also, fixed cell arrays
     of complex types not binding correctly.
   - Renamed BOOST_JOIN to DLIB_BOOST_JOIN to prevent name clashes when working
     with boost.
   - Fixed bug in hysteresis_threshold() that could cause incorrect output.
   - The last release of dlib added more ODR violation checks.  However, these
     could erroneously trigger when using Visual Studio and CUDA in certain
     workflows.  This has been fixed.
   - Fixed matrix objects not working correctly when sized greater than 4GB in
     Visual Studio.
</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.10" date="Mar 19, 2018">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Deep Learning:
      - Added scale_ layer, allowing implementation of squeeze-and-excitation networks.
      - Added loss_multimulticlass_log: used for learning a collection of multi-class classifiers.
   - Added a random forest regression tool. See random_forest_regression_trainer.
   - Added make_bounding_box_regression_training_data()
   - Added isotonic_regression
   - Added momentum_filter, rect_filter, find_optimal_momentum_filter(), and
     find_optimal_rect_filter().
   - Added binomial_random_vars_are_different() and event_correlation().
   - Added xcorr_fft(), a routine for efficiently performing large cross-correlations using the FFT.
   - Added the ramdump type decorator for invoking faster serialization routines.
   - Added check_serialized_version()
   - Added max_scoring_element() and min_scoring_element()
   - Made orthogonalize() faster.
   - Updates to the Python API:
      - Added interface to the global_function_search object.  This is a more general
        interface to the solver used by find_max_global().
      - Added support for variadic Python functions in find_max_global().
      - Added rect_filter and find_optimal_rect_filter().
      - Added make_bounding_box_regression_training_data()
      - Added the image_dataset_metadata routines for parsing XML datasets.
      - Added rvm_trainer
      - Added probability_that_sequence_is_increasing() 
      - Added dlib.__time_compiled__ field
      - Added num_threads to shape_predictor_training_options.
      - Added CUDA controlling routines such as set_device() and 
        set_dnn_prefer_smallest_algorithms().

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed CMake so that there is only the dlib target and it isn't forced to
     be static.  Instead, the build type will toggle based on the state of CMake's
     BUILD_SHARED_LIBS variable.  So there is no longer a dlib_shared target.
   - Changed the integer types used to represent sizes from 32bits to 64bits in numerous
     places, such as in the tensor object.  This should be a backwards compatible change
     for nearly all client code.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed memory leak in java swig array binding tool.
   - Fixed windows include order problem in all/source.cpp file.
   - Fixed cont_ layers not printing the correct num_filters parameter when they were 
     printed to std::cout or to XML.
   - Fixed some code not handling OBJECT_PART_NOT_PRESENT values correctly.
   - Fixed fft_inplace() not compiling for compile time sized matrices.
   - The shape_predictor_trainer could have very bad runtime for some really
     bad parameter settings.  This has been fixed and also warning messages about
     really bad training data or parameters have been added.
   - Fixed the decayed running stats objects so they use unbiased estimators.

</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.9" date="Jan 22, 2018">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Switched the Python API from Boost.Python to pybind11.  This means Python
     users don't need to install Boost anymore, making building dlib's Python API
     much easier.
   - Made the sparse version of svd_fast() use multiple CPU cores.
   - Changed the behavior of imglab's --flip option.  It will now attempt to
     adjust any object part labels so that the flipped dataset has the same
     average part layout as the source dataset. There is also a new --flip-basic 
     option that behaves like the old --flip. However, most people flipping a
     dataset with part annotations will want to use --flip.  For more details
     see: http://blog.dlib.net/2018/01/correctly-mirroring-datasets.html

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Removed std::auto_ptr from dlib's old (and depreciated) smart pointers. 

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed global_optimization.py not working in Python 3.

</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.8" date="Dec 19, 2017">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Added a global optimizer, find_max_global(), which is suitable for
     optimizing expensive functions with many local optima.  For example, you
     can use it for hyperparameter optimization.  See model_selection_ex.cpp
     for an example.
   - Updates to the deep learning tooling:
      - Added semantic segmentation examples: dnn_semantic_segmentation_ex.cpp
        and dnn_semantic_segmentation_train_ex.cpp
      - New layers: loss_ranking, loss_epsilon_insensitive, softmax_all, and loss_dot.
      - Made log loss layers more numerically stable.
      - Upgraded the con layer so you can set the number of rows or columns to
        0 in the layer specification. Doing this means "make the filter cover
        the whole input image dimension".  This provides an easy way to make a
        filter sized so it will have one output along that dimension,
        effectively making it like a fully connected layer operating on a row
        or column.
      - Added support for non-scale-invariant MMOD.
      - Added an optional parameter to dnn_trainer::get_net() that allows you
        to call the function without forcing a state flush to disk.
      - Sometimes the loss_mmod layer could experience excessively long runtime
        during early training iterations.  This has been optimized and is now
        much faster.
      - Optimized the tensor's management of GPU memory.  It now uses less memory
        in some cases.  It will also not perform a reallocation if resized to a
        smaller size.  Instead, tensors now behave like std::vector in that
        they just change their nominal size but keep the same memory, only
        reallocating if they are resized to something larger than their
        underlying memory block. This change makes some uses of dlib faster, in
        particular, running networks on a large set of images of differing
        sizes will now run faster since there won't be any GPU reallocations,
        which are notoriously slow.
      - Upgraded the input layer so you can give
        input&lt;std::array&lt;matrix&lt;T&gt;,K&gt;&gt; types as input. Doing
        this will create input tensors with K channels.
   - Added disjoint_subsets_sized
   - Added Python APIs: get_face_chips(), count_steps_without_decrease(),
     count_steps_without_decrease_robust(), and jitter_image().
   - Various improvements to CMake scripts: e.g. improved warning and error
     messages, added USE_NEON_INSTRUCTIONS option.
   - chol() will use a banded Cholesky algorithm for banded matrices, making it
     much faster in these cases.
   - Changed the timing code to use the C++11 high resolution clock and
     atomics. This makes the timing code a lot more precise.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the random_cropper's set_min_object_size() routine to take min box
     dimensions in the same format as the mmod_options object (i.e. two lengths
     measured in pixels). This should make defining random_cropping strategies
     that are consistent with MMOD settings more straightforward since you can
     simply take the mmod_options settings and give them to the random_cropper
     and it will do the right thing.
   - Changed the mean squared loss layers to return a loss that's the MSE, not
     0.5*MSE. The only thing this effects is the logging messages that print
     during training, which were confusing since the reported loss was half the
     size you might naively expect.
   - Changed the outputs of test_regression_function() and cross_validate_regression_trainer().
     These functions now output 4D rather than 2D vectors.  The new output is:
     mean squared error, correlation, mean absolute error, and standard
     deviation of absolute error.  I also made test_regression_function() take
     a non-const reference to the regression function so that DNN objects can
     be tested.
   - Fixed shape_predictor_trainer padding so it behaves as it used to. In
     dlib 19.7 the padding code was changed and accidentally doubled the size
     of the applied padding in some cases. It's not a huge deal either way, but
     this change reverts back to the previous behavior.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed toMat() not compiling in some cases.
   - Significantly reduced the compile time of the DNN example programs in
     visual studio.
   - Fixed a few image processing functions that weren't using the generic
     image interface.
   - Fixed a bug in the random_cropper where it might crash due to division by
     0 if small images were given as input.
   - Fixed a bug in how the mmod_options automatically determines detection
     window sizes. It would pick a bad size in some cases.
   - Fixed load_image_dataset()'s skip_empty_images() option. It wasn't
     skipping images that only have ignore boxes when you load into mmod_rect
     objects.
   - Fixed a bug where chinese_whispers(), when called from python, would
     sometimes return a labels array that didn't include labels for all the
     inputs.
   - Fixed a bug in dlib's MS Windows GUI code that was introduced a little
     while back when we switched everything to std::shared_ptr.  This change
     fixes a bug where the program crashes or hangs sometimes during program
     shutdown.
   - Fixed error in TIME_THIS() introduced in dlib 19.7. It was printing
     seconds when it said minutes in the output.
   - Adding missing implementation of tabbed_display::selected_tab.
   - Changed the windows signaler and mutex code to use the C++11 thread
     library instead of the old win32 functions. I did this to work around how
     windows unloads dlls. In particular, during dll unload windows will kill
     all threads, THEN it will destruct global objects. So this can lead to
     problems when a global object that owns threads tries to tell them to
     shutdown, since the threads have already vanished.  The new code mitigates
     some of these problems, in particular, there were some cases where
     unloading dlib's python extension would deadlock.  This should now be
     fixed.
   - Fixed compile time errors when either of these macros were enabled:
     DLIB_STACK_TRACE, DLIB_ISO_CPP_ONLY.

<old name="19.7" date="Sep 17, 2017">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Deep Learning:
      - The CNN+MMOD detector is now a multi-class detector.  In particular,
        the mmod_rect object now has a string label field which you can use to
        label objects, and the loss_mmod_ layer will learn to label objects with
        those labels.  For an example, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHbJ7HhbG74
      - CNN+MMOD detectors are now 2.5x faster.  For instance, this example program
        http://dlib.net/dnn_mmod_find_cars_ex.cpp.html now runs at 98fps instead
        of 39fps.  
   - Added a 5 point face landmarking model that is over 10x smaller than the
     68 point model, runs faster, and works with both HOG and CNN generated
     face detections.  It is now the recommended landmarking model to use for 
     face alignment.  render_face_detections() and get_face_chip_details() have been 
     updated to work with both 5 and 68 point models, so the new 5 point model is
     a drop in replacement for the 68 point model.
   - The imglab tool is slightly improved.  It will display box labels with
     higher relative contrast.  You can also now press END or i to ignore boxes
     in imglab. This is useful because it's a much less stressing hand motion
     to hit END that i in most cases.
   - Added overloads of sub_image() that take raw pointers so you can make
     sub_images of anything. 
   - Changed TIME_THIS() to use std::chrono::high_resolution_clock, so now it's
     much higher precision.
   - Exposed Chinese whispers clustering to Python, added face clustering example.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed an error in input_rgb_image_pyramid::image_contained_point(). The
     function might erroneously indicate that a point wasn't inside the original
     image when really it was, causing spurious error messages.
   - mmod_options would pick bad window sizes in some corner cases. This has been fixed.
   - Fixed a bug in the extract layer that trigged when a tensor with a
     different number of samples than the tensor used to initialize the network
     was passed through the layer.
   - The loss_per_missed_target parameter of the loss_mmod_ wasn't being used
     exactly right when boxes were auto-ignored.  There weren't any practical
     user facing problems due to this, but it has nevertheless been fixed.

<old name="19.5" date="Aug 27, 2017">
New Features and Improvements:
   - Deep Learning
      - Added a python wrapper for using the CNN face detector.
      - Added support for cuDNN v6 and v7.
      - Added a simple tool to convert dlib model files to caffe models.  
        See the tools/convert_dlib_nets_to_caffe folder for details.
      - New DNN layers
         - loss_multiclass_log_per_pixel_
         - loss_multiclass_log_per_pixel_weighted_
         - loss_mean_squared_per_pixel_
         - cont_       (transpose convolution, sometimes called "deconvolution")
         - mult_prev_  (like add_prev_ but multiplies instead of adds)
         - extract_    (sort of like caffe's slice layer)
         - upsample_   (upsamples a tensor using bilinear interpolation)
      - Object Detection
         - Upgraded loss_mmod_ to support objects of varying aspect ratio. This
           changes the API for the mmod_options struct slightly.
         - Relaxed the default non-max suppression parameters used by the
           mmod_options object so that users of the deep learning MMOD tool don't
           get spurious errors about impossibly labeled objects during training.
         - Added missing input validation to loss_mmod_.  Specifically, the loss
           layer now checks if the user is giving truth boxes that can't be detected
           because the non-max suppression settings would prevent them from being
           output at the same time. If this happens then we print a warning message
           and set one of the offending boxes to "ignore".  I also changed all
           the input validation errors to warning messages with auto conversion
           to ignore boxes rather than exceptions.
         - Changed the random_cropper's interface so that instead of talking in
           terms of min and max object height, it's now min and max object size.
           This way, if you have objects that are short and wide (i.e. objects where
           the relevant dimension is width rather than height) you will get sensible
           behavior out of the random cropper.
         - Added options to input_rgb_image_pyramid that let the user set
           create_tiled_pyramid()'s padding parameters. Also changed the default
           outer border padding from 0 to 11. This effects even previously trained
           models. So any model that doesn't explicitly set the outer patting to
           something else will have a padding of 11. This should be a more
           reasonable value for most networks.
         - Added process() and process_batch() to add_loss_layer. These routines
           let you easily pass arguments to any optional parameters of a loss
           layer's to_tensor() routine. For instance, it makes it more convenient to
           set loss_mmod_'s adjust_threshold parameter.
      - Added visit_layers_until_tag()
      - Improved how dnn_trainer synchronizes its state to disk.  It now uses
        two files and alternates between them.  This should be more robust in
        the face of random hardware failure during synchronization than the
        previous synchronization method.
      - Made it so you can set the number of output filters for con_ layers at runtime.
      - The way cuDNN work buffers are managed has been improved, leading to
        less GPU RAM usage.  Therefore, users should not need to call
        set_dnn_prefer_smallest_algorithms() anymore.
      - Added operator&lt;&lt; for random_cropper and dnn_trainer to allow 
        easy logging of training parameters.
      - Made concat_ layer a lot faster.
      - Made the dnn_trainer not forget all the previous loss values it knows
        about when it determines that there have been a lot of steps without
        progress and shrinks the learning rate. Instead, it removes only a
        small amount of the oldest values.   The problem with the old way of
        removing all the loss values in the history was that if you set the
        steps without progress threshold to a really high number you would
        often observe that the last few learning rate values were obviously not
        making progress, however, since all the previous loss values were
        forgotten the trainer needed to fully populate its loss history from
        scratch before it would figure this out.  This new style makes the
        trainer not waste time running this excessive optimization of obviously
        useless mini-batches.  I also changed the default
        get_test_iterations_without_progress_threshold() from 200 to 500.  Now
        that we have a better history management of loss values in the trainer
        it's much more sensible to have a larger value here.
   - Dlib's simd classes will now use ARM NEON instructions.  This makes the
     HOG based object detector faster on mobile devices running ARM processors.
   - Added last_modified() method to dlib::file.  Also, added
     select_oldest_file() and select_newest_file().
   - Added solve_qp_box_constrained_blockdiag()
   - Added an overload of mat() that takes a row stride value.
   - Added cmake scripts and some related tooling that makes it easy to call
     C++ code from java.  See dlib/java/ folder.  
   - MATLAB MEX wrapper API
      - Made the mex wrapper deal with cell arrays that have null elements.
      - Made ctrl+c detection in a mex file work more reliably in newer versions of matlab.
   - Added set_rect_area()
   - Gave test_object_detection_function() an option to set how ignore box
     overlap is tested.
   - Added serialization support for the running_stats_decayed object.
   - Additions to imglab
      - Added --sort and also the ability to propagate boxes from one image to
        the next using dlib::correlation_tracker.
      - Made it so you can remove images by pressing alt+d. 
      - Made is so pressing e in imglab toggles between views of the image
        where the histogram is equalized or unmodified. This way, if you are
        looking at particularly dark or badly contrasted images you can toggle
        this mode and maybe get a better view of what you are labeling.
   - Made the attribute_list of the xml parser a little more friendly by
     allowing you to ask for attributes that don't exist and get a defined
     behavior (an exception being thrown) rather than it being a contract
     violation.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - DNN solver objects are now required to declare operator&lt;&lt;.
   - Broke backwards compatibility with previous dnn_trainer serialization
     format.  The network serialization format has not changed however.  So old
     model files will still load properly.
   - Changed random_cropper interface.
   - Changed the XML format output by net_to_xml(). Specifically, the XML tag
     for affine layers was changed to use the same conventions as other layers
     that support convolutional vs fully connected modes.
   - Dlib's smart pointers have been deprecated and all of dlib's code has been
     changed to use the std:: version of these smart pointers.  The old dlib
     smart pointers are still present, allowing users to explicitly include
     them if needed, but users should migrate to the C++11 standard version of
     these tools. 
   - Changed the functions that transform between input tensor coordinates and
     output tensor coordinates to use dpoint instead of point. This way, we can
     obtain sub-pixel coordinates if we need them.
   - Upgraded loss_mmod_ to support objects of varying aspect ratio. This
     changes the API for the mmod_options struct slightly.

Bug fixes:
   - Made resize_image() and functions that use it like the pyramid objects
     produce better results when run on float and double images. There was
     needless rounding to integers happening in the bilinear interpolation. Now
     if you work with a float image the entire process will run without integer
     rounding.
   - Made the input_tensor_to_output_tensor() and output_tensor_to_input_tensor() 
     coordinate mappings work on networks that contain skip layers.
   - The input_rgb_image_sized is supposed to be convertible to
     input_rgb_image, which it was in all ways except you couldn't deserialize
     directly like you would expect. This has now been fixed.
   - There was a bug in the concat_ layer's backward() method. It was assigning
     the gradient to previous layers instead of adding the gradient, as required
     by the layer interface specification.  Probably no-one has been impacted
     by this bug, but it's still a bug and has been fixed.
   - Changed the random_cropper so that it samples background patches uniformly
     across scales regardless of the input image size. Previously, if you gave
     really large images or really small images it had a bias towards giving only
     large patches or small patches respectively.
   - Fixed name lookup problem for calls to serialize() on network objects.
   - Fixed double delete in tokenizer_kernel_1.
   - Fixed error in pyramid_down&lt;2&gt; that caused the output image to be a
     little funny looking in some cases.
   - Fixed the visit_layers_backwards() and visit_layers_backwards_range()
     routines so they visit layers in the correct order.
   - Made build scripts work on a wider range of platforms and configurations.
   - Worked around global timer cleanup issues that occur on windows when dlib
     is used in a dll in some situations.
   - Fixed various compiler errors in obscure environments.

Other:

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="19.3" date="Feb 21, 2017">
New Features:
   - Deep Learning
      - Added a state-of-the-art face recognition tool (99.38% accuracy on the
        LFW benchmark) with C++ and Python example programs.
      - Added these new loss layer types: loss_metric_, loss_mean_squared_, and
        loss_mean_squared_multioutput_.
      - Added the l2normalize_ computational layer.
      - Added test_one_step() to the dnn_trainer. This allows you to do
        automatic early stopping based on observing the loss on held out data.
      - Made the dnn_trainer automatically reload from the last good state if a
        loss of NaN is encountered.
      - Made alias_tensor usable when it is const.
   - Dlib's simd classes will now use PowerPC VSX instructions.  This makes the
     HOG based object detector faster on PowerPC machines.
   - Added compute_roc_curve()
   - Added find_gap_between_convex_hulls()
   - Added serialization support for std::array.
   - Added running_scalar_covariance_decayed object
   - Added running_stats_decayed object
   - Added min_pointwise() and max_pointwise().
   - Added a 1D clustering routine: segment_number_line().
   - Added Intel MKL FFT bindings.
   - Added matlab_object to the mex wrapper. Now you can have parameters that
     are arbitrary matlab objects.
   - Added support for loading of RGBA JPEG images

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the loss layer interface to use two typedefs, output_label_type
     and training_label_type instead of a single label_type. This way, the label
     type used for training can be distinct from the type output by the network.
     This change breaks backwards compatibility with the previous API.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed compiler warnings and errors on newer compilers.
   - Fixed a bug in the repeat layer that caused it to throw exceptions in some
     cases.
   - Fixed matlab crashing if an error message from a mex file used the %
     character, since that is interpreted by matlab as part of an eventual
     printf() code.
   - Fixed compile time error in random_subset_selector::swap()
   - Fixed missing implementation of map_input_to_output() and
     map_output_to_input() in the concat_ layer.
   - Made the dnn_trainer's detection and backtracking from situations with
     increasing loss more robust. Now it will never get into a situation where it
     backtracks over and over. Instead, it will only backtrack a few times in a
     row before just letting SGD run unimpeded.

Other:
   - Usability improvements to DNN API.
   - Improved C++11 detection, especially on OS X.
   - Made dlib::thread_pool use std::thread and join on the threads in
     thread_pool's destructor. The previous implementation used dlib's global
     thread pooling to allocate threads to dlib::thread_pool, however, this
     sometimes caused annoying behavior when used as part of a MATLAB mex file,
     very occasionally leading to matlab crashes when mex files were unloaded.
     This also means that dlib::thread_pool construction is a little bit slower
     than it used to be.

<old name="19.2" date="Oct 10, 2016">
New Features:
   - Updates to the deep learning API:
      - Added tools for making convolutional neural network based object detectors.  See
        dnn_mmod_ex.cpp example program.
      - Added annotation() to tensor so you can associate any object you want with a tensor.
      - Made layer_details() part of the SUBNET interface so that user defined layer
        details objects can access each other. Also added the input_layer() global function
        for accessing the input layer specifically.
      - alias_tensor can now create aliases of const tensors.
      - Added set_all_bn_running_stats_window_sizes().
      - Added visit_layers_backwards(), visit_layers_backwards_range(), and
        visit_layers_range().
      - Computational layers can now optionally define map_input_to_output() and
        map_output_to_input() member functions.  If all layers of a network provide these
        functions then the new global functions input_tensor_to_output_tensor() and
        output_tensor_to_input_tensor() can be used to map between the network's input and
        output tensor coordinates.  This is important for fully convolutional object
        detectors since they need to map between the image space and final feature space.
        These new functions are important for tools like the new MMOD detector.
      - Added input_rgb_image_pyramid.
   - Image Processing
      - The imglab command line tool has these new options: --min-object-size, --rmempty,
        --rmlabel, --rm-if-overlaps, and --sort-num-objects.  I also changed the behavior of
        --split so that it simply partitions the data and is an invertible operation.
      - Added mmod_rect
      - Added an overload of load_image_dataset() that outputs directly to mmod_rect
        instead of rectangle.
      - Added image_dataset_file::shrink_big_images(). So now load_image_dataset() can load
        a dataset of high resolution files at a user requested lower resolution.
      - Added box_intersection_over_union().
      - Added create_tiled_pyramid(), image_to_tiled_pyramid(), and tiled_pyramid_to_image().
      - Added random_cropper
   - Upgraded dlib's mex wrapper tooling to enable easy binding of C++ classes to MATLAB
     objects. 
   - Added nearest_rect()
   - Added find_upper_quantile()
   - Added count_steps_without_decrease_robust().
   - Added get_double_in_range() to dlib::rand.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - C++11 is now required to use dlib.  
   - Changed pinv() so it interprets its tol argument relative to the largest singular
     value of the input matrix rather than as an absolute tolerance.  This should generally
     improve results, but could change the output in some cases.
   - Renamed the class members of test_box_overlap so they are less confusing.
   - Updates to the deep learning API:
      - Changed the DNN API so that sample_expansion_factor is a runtime variable rather
        than a compile time constant. This also removes it from the input layer interface
        since the DNN core now infers its value at runtime. Therefore, users that define their
        own input layers don't need to specify it anymore.
      - Changed DEFAULT_BATCH_NORM_EPS from 1e-5 to 1e-4.
      - Changed the default batch normalization running stats window from 1000 to 100.

Bug fixes:
   - Made the relational operators constexpr so they don't accidentally cause compilation
     errors when they get pulled into the scope of template metaprogramming expressions.
   - Fixed all/source.cpp not compiling in some instances.
   - CMake scripts now do a better job detecting things like C++11 support, the presence of
     CUDA, and other system specific details that could cause the build to fail if not
     properly configured.
   - Fixed a bug in imglab's --cluster option where it would output xml files with empty
     entries if the input xml file contained unannotated images.
   - Fixed imglab's --cluster option not working with relative paths.

Other:
   - Made the thread local variables that hold the cudnn and cublas context objects not
     destruct and recreate themselves when you switch devices.  Instead, they keep a table
     of context objects, for each thread and device, reusing as necessary. This prevents
     churn in the context objects when you are switching back and forth between devices
     inside a single thread, making things run more efficiently for some CUDA based
     workflows.
   - Made the message argument of the DLIB_ASSERT and DLIB_CASSERT macros optional.
   - Made thread_pool and parallel_for propagate exceptions from task threads to calling
     code rather than killing the application if a task thread throws.
   - Changed imglab --resample so that it never changes the aspect ratio of an image.
   - Made the check in dnn_trainer for convergence more robust. Previously, if we
     encountered a bad mini-batch that made the loss value suddenly jump up by a larger than
     normal value it could make the trainer think we converged. Now the test is robust to
     transient spikes in loss value.  Additionally, the dnn_trainer will now check if the
     loss has been increasing before it saves the state to disk. If it detects that the loss
     has been going up then instead of saving to disk it recalls the previously good state.
     This way, if we hit a really bad mini-batch during training which negatively effects
     the model in a significant way, the dnn_trainer will automatically revert back to an
     earlier good state.

   - Fixed a minor bug in extract_highdim_face_lbp_descriptors() which was
     pointed out by Yan Xu. One of the face locations was mistakenly used twice
     while another was skipped. This change breaks backwards compatibility with
     the previous feature extraction output but should slightly improve
     accuracy of classifiers trained using these features.
   - Fixed jet() and heatmap() so they work on empty images.
   - The SQLite transaction object did not function correctly when compiled 
     in a C++11 program.  Since its destructor can throw, an exception
     specification needed to be added indicating that this was possible since
     destructors are now noexcept by default in C++11.
   - Fixed a bug pointed out by Ernesto Tapia that could cause matrix
     expressions that involve sub matrix views (e.g. colm) to produce the wrong
     results when the BLAS bindings were enabled.
   - Added an if to avoid a possible division by zero inside spectral_cluster().
   - Fixed a bug in parse_xml(). It failed to check if the given input stream
     was valid before trying to parse it.

<old name="18.16" date="Jun 3, 2015">
New Features:
   - Added a linear model predictive control solver.  See the mpc_ex.cpp example
     program for details.
   - Thanks to Patrick Snape, the correlation_tracker can now be used from Python.
      
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - The camera_transform's second operator() method now takes 3 arguments
     instead of 2.  This is to allow it to output the z distance in addition to
     scale.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in the eigenvalue_decomposition which could occur when a
     symmetric matrix was used along with the LAPACK bindings.
   - Fixed a bug where the last column of data in a file wasn't loaded on some
     OS X machines when load_libsvm_formatted_data() was called.

Other:
   - Added a hard iteration limit to a number of the SVM solvers.
   - Adrian Rosebrock graciously setup an OS X machine for dlib testing, which
     resulted in improved CMake python scripts on OS X machines.

      - Added camera_transform.  It performs the 3D to 2D mapping needed to visualize 3D
        data.
      - Added point_transform_affine3d as well as functions for creating such transforms:
        rotate_around_x(), rotate_around_y(), rotate_around_z(), and translate_point().
   - Added draw_solid_circle() for drawing on images.
   - Added get_best_hough_point() to the hough_transform.
   - Thanks to Jack Culpepper, the python API for object detection now outputs detection
     confidences.  
   - Added lspi, an implementation of the least-squares policy iteration algorithm.
      
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - The shape_predictor and shape_predictor_trainer had a non-optimal behavior when used
     with objects that have non-square bounding boxes. This has been fixed but will cause
     models that were trained with the previous version of dlib to not work as accurately if
     they used non-square boxes. So you might have to retrain your models when updating dlib.

Bug fixes:

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in extract_image_chips() and get_mapping_to_chip() that caused
     incorrect outputs when the requested chip stretched the image unevenly
     vertically or horizontally.
   - Made CMake check that libpng and libjpeg actually contain the link symbols
     they are supposed to since, on some systems, these libraries aren't
     installed correctly and will cause linker errors if used.
   - Fixed assign_border_pixels(img, rect) so that it correctly zeros an image
     when an empty rectangle is supplied. Previously, it did nothing to the
     image in this case.
   - Fixed compute_lda_transform() so it works properly when the class
     covariance matrices are singular even after performing PCA.
   - Fixed a bug in find_similarity_transform(). When given just two points as
     inputs it would sometimes produce a reflection rather than a similarity
     transform.
   - Disabled all bindings to FFTW because FFTW isn't threadsafe.

Other:

   - Made the extract_image_chips() routine more flexible, in particular: Added
     get_mapping_to_chip(), get_face_chip_details(), map_det_to_chip(), and also
     upgraded chip_details so you can specify a chip extraction by a bunch of
     point correspondences between the chip and the original image.
   - Added a set of local-binary-pattern based feature extractors:
     make_uniform_lbp_image(), extract_histogram_descriptors(),
     extract_uniform_lbp_descriptors(), and extract_highdim_face_lbp_descriptors() 
   - Added compute_lda_transform()

New Features:
   - Added find_similarity_transform()
   - Added the ability to upgrade a auto_mutex_readonly from a readonly lock to a write
     lock. 
   - Added an implementation of the paper "One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble
     of Regression Trees" by Vahid Kazemi and Josephine Sullivan which appeared in this
     year's CVPR conference.  Therefore, dlib now includes tools for learning shape models
     and also comes with a state-of-the-art face landmark locator.  See the
     face_landmark_detection_ex.cpp and train_shape_predictor_ex.cpp example programs for
     an introduction.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Made the interface to all the image processing routines more generic.  In particular, 
     it is now easier to use arbitrary image types with dlib.  The new generic image
     interface is defined in dlib/image_processing/generic_image.h and simply consists of
     seven user defined global functions and a traits template.  Any user code that was
     using array2d objects to represent images will still work.  However, if you had been
     using your own custom image object you will need to provide implementations of the
     seven functions.  Instructions for how to do this are in
     dlib/image_processing/generic_image.h.

Bug fixes:
   - Changed the murmur hash implementation to avoid any possibility of strict aliasing
     violations in user code, even when things get inlined in unfavorable ways.
   - Fixed a color space handling bug in resize_image() that caused bad looking outputs in
     some cases.
   - If "cmake" was a substring of the full path to your source code folder then the cmake
     scripts would fail. This has been fixed.
   - Fixed a compile time error that could occur when using find_max_single_variable().

Other:
   - load_image() now uses the internal file header information to detect the
     image format rather than looking at the file extension.
   - Renamed unit test program to dtest avoid warnings from CMake.
   - cross_validate_trainer() and cross_validate_trainer_threaded() no loner make copies
     of the training data.  This significantly reduces their RAM usage for large datasets.
   - Changed the serialization code for C-strings so that they don't save the null
     terminator byte. This makes their serialization format the same as the format for
     std::string.  The code should still be able to read all previously serialized data
     correctly, so the change is backwards compatible with previous versions of dlib. 
   - Changed the evaluate_detectors() routine so that it applies non-max suppression to
     each detector individually. This way one detector doesn't stomp on the output of
     another detector.
   - Made the version of draw_line() that draws onto a regular image use alpha blending
     for drawing diagonal lines.

   - You can now make a 1x1 matrix containing a single value by calling mat() on a single
     scalar value.
   - The point transform functions and frobmetric_training_sample are now serializable.
   - Added a simplified operator &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; based syntax for serializing to and
     from files.  So now you can serialize to a file using a syntax of:
       serialize("myfile.dat") &lt;&lt; myobject &lt;&lt; another_object;

     more details.
   - Added the ability to use a user supplied fHOG style feature extractor with 
     the scan_fhog_pyramid object.  So now you can define your own version of HOG
     for use with these tools.
   - The oca solver now supports taking a user supplied prior vector. That is,
     it lets you use a regularizer like ||w-prior||^2 instead of the usual
     ||w||^2 regularizer.
   - Added the structural_track_association_trainer object.  It is a structural
     SVM tool for creating multi-target tracking algorithms.  See the
     learning_to_track_ex.cpp example program for an introduction.
   - Added the following minor utility functions: nearest_center(),
     add_image_rotations(), set_aspect_ratio(), and tile_images().

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Refactored the load_image_dataset() routines so they are easier to use and
     more flexible. This introduces a slight backwards incompatibility in that
     the version that loads full_object_detection objects now returns an ignore
     rectangle set instead of a parts name list.  Other than that the changes
     are backwards compatible with previous versions of dlib.
   - Added a bias term to the assignment_function's model so the user doesn't
     need to remember, or even understand, that they should add it themselves.
     However, this change breaks backwards compatibility with the previous
     serialization format for assignment_function objects.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a number of compile time errors that could occur in rare cases.
   - The stopping condition for the svr_linear_trainer was too tight, causing it
     to take an excessive amount of time to converge in some cases. 
   - Disabled use of XIM for X11 windowing since it makes programs hang on some
     systems. However, this means the wide character input methods won't work on
     X11 systems anymore.
   - Fixed a bug in randomize_samples() which caused the outputs to be not as
     random as they should be. 
   - Fixed dlib's CMakeLists.txt file so that the "use FFTW" option actually
     causes the build to use FFTW.
   - Fixed a compile time error that triggered when trying to link with FFTW.

      - Added an option to include "ignore/don't care" truth boxes to the
        structural_object_detection_trainer.  This allows a user to tell the trainer that
        they don't care if certain objects are detected or not detected.  
   - Image Processing Tools:
      - Added extract_image_chips()
      - Added a version of draw_rectangle() for drawing on images.
      - The spatial filtering routines now support even sized filters.
      - Added flip_image_dataset_left_right(), upsample_image_dataset(), and

      - Added a nuclear norm regularization option to the structural SVM solver.
      - Added the option to learn only non-negative weights to the
        svm_multiclass_linear_trainer.
   - Speed Improvements:
      - The svm_multiclass_linear_trainer, one_vs_one_trainer, and one_vs_all_trainer
        objects are now multithreaded.  This also means you have to #include
        dlib/svm_threaded.h instead of dlib/svm.h to use these tools. 
      - A number of image processing tools can now optionally use SSE and AVX instructions
        and are therefore considerably faster.  In particular, the following tools have been
        accelerated: extract_fhog_features, resize_image, pyramid_down, pyramid_up,
        spatially_filter_image_separable, and spatially_filter_image.
   - Added an inv() routine that inverts point transformation functions.
   - Added a sign() routine for matrix objects.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - The spatial image filtering functions have the following changes:
      - They no longer zero the image borders when you set the add_to parameter to true.  
      - The spatially_filter_image_separable_down() routine now only allows grayscale
        output images.
   - Changed the default parameters of the test_box_overlap object. Now it defaults to
     using exactly the PASCAL VOC match criterion.
   - To use the svm_multiclass_linear_trainer, one_vs_one_trainer, or one_vs_all_trainer
     objects you now have to #include dlib/svm_threaded.h instead of dlib/svm.h. 
   - pyramid_up() no longer has a levels option.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a compile time bug that could occur when wide character strings were
     serialized.
   - Fixed a compile time bug occurring in gcc 4.7.1 on SUSE Linux.  Thanks to Volker
     Härtel for finding this.
   - Fixed compile time errors that occurred when using gcc on cygwin.
   - Fixed a compile time bug that could occur when serializing mlp objects.
   - Fixed a bug in the bigint object that caused division to sometimes produce incorrect
     results.
   - Fixed a bug which sometimes caused load_image_dataset() to erroneously report that
     the dataset file could not be found.
   - Fixed a bug in the structural_object_detection_trainer that caused it to erroneously
     throw a impossible_labeling_error exception in certain rare cases.
   - Updated find_max_factor_graph_nmplp() to use the improved version of the algorithm
     from the 2011 paper Introduction to dual decomposition for inference by David Sontag,
     Amir Globerson, and Tommi Jaakkola.  The original algorithm presented in their 2008
     paper had an error that negatively affected its convergence.  Thanks to James Gunning
     for pointing this out.

Other:
   - Fixed many compiler warnings in gcc 4.8.
   - Made many of the mat() converters bind the resulting matrix expressions into BLAS
     functions.
   - libpng and libjpeg are now included in the dlib/external folder to enable easy static
     linking to these libraries on platforms that typically don't have them (e.g. Windows).
     Moreover, dlib's cmake files will automatically perform this static linking when no

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Refactored the image pyramid code. Now there is just one templated object called
     pyramid_down and you give it the downsampling amount as a template argument.  To make
     old code work with this change use the following substitutions:
       change pyramid_down to pyramid_down&lt;2&gt;

   - Made the structural SVM solver slightly faster.
   - Moved the python C++ utility headers from tools/python/src into dlib/python.
   - The PNG loader is now able to load grayscale images with an alpha channel.
   - Removed checks that prevented users from using references to functions with the
     optimization code and forced the use of function pointers. This was to avoid
     triggering a bug in gcc 4.0.  Since that compiler is no longer officially supported
     by dlib I've removed these checks to increase usability.
   - Made resize_image() use bilinear interpolation by default and also added a special
     version of it that is optimized for this case.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the object detector testing functions to output average precision instead of
     mean average precision.
   - Added an option to weight the features from a hashed_feature_image relative to the
     number of times they occur in an image.  I also made it the default behavior to use
     this relative weighting and changed the serialization format to accommodate this.

Bug fixes:

        an arbitrary set of object boxes which should be checked by an object
        detector rather than scanning a fixed sized window over the image as is
        done by the scan_image_pyramid tool.  This allows more flexible scanning 
        strategies.  For example, it is now possible to use the selective search

   - Added the image_window::get_next_keypress() routine.  This tool allows a
     user to easily find out which keyboard key the user is pressing.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the object_detector interface slightly.  In particular, it no
     longer adds the adjust_threshold argument to the output scores.    
   - The object detector testing functions now output mean average precision in
     addition to precision and recall.
   - Changed how dlib does serialization in a number of ways:
      - The running_stats and scan_image_pyramid objects have had their
        serialization format changed in a way that breaks backwards
        compatibility.  This means serialized versions of these objects can't be
        loaded by the new version of dlib.
      - Changed the format dlib uses when it serializes floating point values.
        Previously, we used an ASCII based format.  Dlib now uses a much more
        efficient binary format. However, the deserialization routines have
        been made backwards compatible with the previous format. So dlib can
        still deserialize older data but older software won't be able to read
        the new format.
      - Changed the serialization formats for the matrix and array2d objects so
        that either object can be deserialized into the other. This was done in a
        way that is backwards compatible with previous versions of dlib. That is,
        we can still load data serialized by previous dlib versions. However,
        older versions of dlib can't load the new serialization format.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in save_dng() that happened sometimes when saving images with
     unsigned char pixels.
   - The test_ranking_function() and cross_validate_ranking_trainer() routines
     computed incorrect MAP scores when the learned function output a constant
     value for all samples.  This has been fixed.

Other:
   - Gave load_image_dataset() the ability to skip images that don't have any
     ground truth boxes.
   - Changed average_precision() to use interpolated precision. So now it uses
     the same metric as the one used by the Pascal VOC challenge.
   - Upgraded the dng image format so it can natively store floating point
     pixel types without any information loss.

<old name="18.1" date="Mar 25, 2013">
New Features:
   - Added svd_fast(), a routine for computing a singular value decomposition of very 
     large matrices.
   - Added cca(), a routine for doing canonical correlation analysis on very large 
     and high-dimensional datasets.
   - Added tools for creating parallel for loops, see parallel_for().
   - Added some features to the image display widgets to let the user easily
     get information about where the user is clicking.  This is the new 
     get_next_double_click() routine.
   - Added an operator>> for matrix objects which allows you to read in ASCII
     matrices using the format used by operator&lt;&lt;.
   - Added serialization support for std::vector&lt;bool&gt;.
   - Added the following new minor objects and routines: average_precision(), 
     make_sparse_vector_inplace(), orthogonalize(), count_bits(), draw_surf_points(),
     hamming_distance(), cosine_distance, and negative_dot_product_distance.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed ranking evaluation functions to return the mean average precision
     in addition to just raw ranking accuracy. This changes their return types
     from double to matrix&lt;double,1,2&gt;.
   - Generalized segment_image() so it works on any pixel type or array of
     vectors.  I also changed its interface slightly.  In particular, I removed
     the min_diff parameter and replaced it with an explicit min_size parameter.
   - Changed how the SURF descriptor is computed slightly to improve its
     accuracy.  The interface to the user has not been changed, however, the
     number and position of detected SURF points might be different than in
     previous dlib versions.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed an endianness bug in the PNG I/O functions which occurred when 16bit
     grayscale PNGs were used. 
   - Fixed a bug which could potentially occur when empty std::vector&lt;char&gt; or
     std::vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; were serialized.
   - There was a bug in the version of draw_line() that draws directly onto an
     array2d type image (not the one that draws onto a GUI canvas object). The
     bug triggered whenever a perfectly horizontal or vertical line that extended
     outside the image was drawn. This has been fixed.
   - Fixed a bug in the Windows implementation of the signaler object, which
     was found by Isaac Peterson. The bug caused the program to deadlock if
     signal() or broadcast() was called at exactly the same time a
     wait_or_timeout() function timed out.
   - Fixed a bug in the image_window and image_display GUI tools which caused
     them to not redraw overlay lines correctly in certain cases involving
     non-default zoom levels.
   - Switched randomly_color_image() to use the non-pointer based version of
     murmur_hash3() to avoid violation of the strict aliasing rule. In
     particular, the previous version didn't work correctly in gcc 4.7.2 when
     optimizations were enabled.
   - Visual Studio 2012's iostreams library has a bug which caused the
     iosockstream to crash on use.  This version of dlib has been changed to
     avoid triggering this bug.

Other:
   - Refactored the Platt scaling code a little. Now there is a function,
     learn_platt_scaling(), that allows you to directly call the Platt scaling
     code without supplying a trainer object.
   - Optimized the oca and structural SVM solvers.  They are now a little bit faster 
     than in previous dlib releases.

</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="18.0" date="Feb 04, 2013">
New Features:
   - Machine Learning
      - Added svm_rank_trainer, an optimized implementation of the SVM-Rank algorithm.
      - Added rank_unlabeled_training_samples(), an implementation of the SVM Active
        Learning algorithm.
      - Added svm_c_linear_dcd_trainer, a warm-startable SVM solver using the dual 
        coordinate descent algorithm used by liblinear.
      - Added the ability to force the last element of a weight vector to 1 to the
        following objects: svm_c_linear_trainer, svm_c_linear_dcd_trainer,
        svm_rank_trainer, and oca.
      - Added the ability to learn non-negative weight vectors to the
        structural_sequence_labeling_trainer object.
   - Networking
      - Added an iosockstream object.
      - Added a method to the server object that lets a user set the graceful close timeout
        time to something other than the default of 500ms.
   - Linear Algebra
      - Added the gaussian_randm() function.
      - Added the find_affine_transform() function.
      - Added the mat() function.  It combines the array_to_matrix(), vector_to_matrix(),
        pointer_to_column_vector(), and pointer_to_matrix() methods all into one convenient
        interface.   mat() also works for Armadillo and Eigen matrices.
      - Added STL style begin() and end() methods to matrix and matrix_exp.
      - Added an overload of sparse_matrix_vector_multiply() that multiplies a dense matrix
        with a sparse vector.
      - Made toMat() work with the matrix object in addition to array2d style images.
   - Graphical User Interface Tools
      - Added draw_solid_convex_polygon().
      - Added an overload of draw_image() that's useful for drawing images and doing
        interpolation at the same time.
      - Added the on_view_changed() callback to zoomable_region and scrollable_region widgets.
   - Added parse_trees_to_string() and parse_trees_to_string_tagged().
   - Added lambda function support to the timeout object.
   - Added the vectorstream object.
   - Added the parse_xml() routines.
   - Added a group name feature to the command line parser.  Now it is possible to make
     print_options() print related options in named groups. 
   - Added the following new hashing functions: murmur_hash3_128bit_3(),
     murmur_hash3_2(), murmur_hash3_3(), uniform_random_hash(), gaussian_random_hash() 
     as well as hash() overloads for uint32, uint64, and std::pair.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Made the svm_c_linear_trainer use the risk gap to decide when to stop.  This was done
     because it is how all the other OCA based SVM tools in dlib decide when to stop.  
     However, it might cause the outputs to be slightly different in this version of dlib.  
   - It is now illegal to call unlock() on a mutex when the mutex is not owned by the
     calling thread.  The most likely reason for doing this was to unlock early in an area
     locked by an auto_mutex.  Old code that does this can be fixed by calling auto_mutex's
     unlock() function instead.  
   - Removed the structural_assignment_trainer::learns_nonnegative_weights() routine 
     and moved its functionality into the feature extraction interface used by this object. 

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in find_max_factor_graph_nmplp() which caused it to not work properly on
     some compilers.
   - Fixed a bug pointed out by Joel Nelson in the version of md5() that took an istream.
     The bug caused the function to crash on strings longer than 56 characters.

Other:
   - dlib now has an excellent new logo thanks to Yasser Asmi. 
   - Added a new documentation page for the various linear algebra tools.
   - The following objects were turned into single implementation components:
     sockstreambuf, timeout, member_function_pointer, xml_parser, linker,
     bound_function_pointer, and timer.

</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="17.49" date="Dec 18, 2012">
New Features:
   - Machine Learning
      - Added the ability to learn non-negative weight vectors to the
        structural_assignment_trainer object.
      - Added two new graph clustering algorithms: Chinese Whispers and Newman's modularity
        clustering.
      - Added a number of new graph manipulation tools: sparse_matrix_vector_multiply(),
        is_ordered_by_index(), find_neighbor_ranges(), convert_unordered_to_ordered(),
        remove_duplicate_edges(), and the ordered_sample_pair object.
   - Networking
      - Added a set of tools for creating applications using the Bulk Synchronous Parallel
        computing model.  See the new bsp_ex.cpp example program for an introduction.
      - Added a routine that lets a user disable Nagle's algorithm on a TCP connection.
      - Added an asynchronous start routine to the server object.  This is the new
        start_async() method.
      - Added the network_address object.
      - Added connect_to() to the bridge interface.
   - Added find_max_parse_cky(), a method implementing the well known CKY algorithm for
     parsing probabilistic context free grammars.
   - Added the ability to label parts of objects with the mouse to the image_display
     widget.
   - Added the ability to put overlay circles and full_object_detections into the
     image_window widget.
   - Added a stddev() for matrix objects.
   - Added operator+() for running_stats and running_scalar_covariance.
   - Added an overload of murmur_hash3_128bit() that takes 4 integers instead of a block of
     memory.
   - Added rand::get_random_64bit_number().

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the image_dataset_metadata XML reading tools to use a map of strings to points
     to represent object parts. This change removes the old head point from a box since
     this information can now be represented in the parts map.
   - The syntax for passing order_by_distance and order_by_index to std::sort() is now
     slightly different since these functions are now templates.  However, this change
     allows them to work on any kind of sample_pair or ordered_sample_pair object.
   - The default distance value of a sample_pair is now initialized to 1 instead of
     infinity.

Bug fixes:
   - Added a patch, contributed by Martin Müllenhaupt, to fix a minor bug in the SQLite
     bindings.
   - Fixed a typo which would prevent code that called running_stats::max_n() from
     compiling.

Other:
   - Added a new documentation page for the various graph tools in dlib.
   - Added support for Visual Studio 2012.
   - Switched the sample_pair object to use double to store its distance value instead of
     float.
   - Added William Sobel's patch to the web server that improves its flexibility and
     security.
   - Changed the server object so you don't have to use the server::kernel_1a syntax to
     declare it anymore.  Now you just say server, server_iostream, or server_http
     depending on which one you want.
   - Changed the cmd_line_parser so you don't have to use the ::kernel_1a syntax anymore.
     Now it is declared like a normal single implementation object.
   - Set the default max number of connections a server will accept at a time to 1000
     rather than the previous default of infinity.

</old>

<!-- **************************************************************************************  -->

<old name="17.48" date="Oct 18, 2012">
New Features:
  - Added more overloads of find_max_factor_graph_potts() to make applying it 
    over a Markov random field of image pixels really simple.
  - Added overloads of serialize()/deserialize() so that they can serialize
    Google protocol buffer objects.
  - Image Processing:
      - Added find_points_above_thresh()
      - Added max_filter() 
      - Added scan_image_movable_parts()
      - Added sum_filter_assign()
      - Added the full_object_detection object.
      - Added the ability to model objects with movable parts into the
        scan_image_pyramid object.  This update also includes all the needed tools
        to train movable part models using the structural_object_detection_trainer.
  - Machine Learning:
      - Added a per node loss option to the structural_svm_graph_labeling_problem's
        interface.
      - Added Emanuele Cesena's implementation of Sammon's nonlinear dimensionality
        reduction method.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
  - To support movable part models, the serialization format of scan_image_pyramid
    objects was modified.  This breaks backwards compatibility with the previous
    format for scan_image_pyramid objects as well as object_detector instances
    that use the scan_image_pyramid.

Bug fixes:
  - Fixed a bug in auto_threshold_image() that caused it to give bad outputs 
    when used with very large images.

Other:
  - Updated find_max_factor_graph_potts() to correctly say you can use infinite
    weights for the factor_value_disagreement() values since the code actually
    supports this.
  - Made integer serialization about 3 times faster.

<!-- *******************************************************************************  -->

<old name="17.47" date="Jun 15, 2012">
New Features:
   - Improvements to linear algebra tools:
      - Added the lowerbound() and upperbound() routines for thresholding dense 
        matrices.
      - Refined the tools for working with sparse vectors.  In particular, 
        the following functions were added: min(), max(), make_sparse_vector(),
        add(), and subtract().  A number of existing routines were also updated
        to work with both sparse and dense vectors so that templated code which 
        works on both vector types is simpler to write.
      - Added the += and -= operators to the set_subm(), set_rowm(), and set_colm()
        tools for operating on submatrices.
   - Optimization:
      - Added a new quadratic program solver, solve_qp4_using_smo().  This new
        solver is useful for solving quadratic programs corresponding to
        non-negative constrained primal quadratic programs.
      - Added an optional non-negativity constraint to the oca optimizer.
      - Added the min_cut object.  It provides a method to find the minimum weight 
        cut on a graph.  
      - Added tools for finding the maximum probability assignment in a Potts 
        style Markov random field.  See the find_max_factor_graph_potts() routine 
        for details.
   - Machine Learning:
      - Added structural SVM tools for learning the parameters of a Potts style
        Markov random field.  See the structural_graph_labeling_trainer and
        graph_labeler objects as well as their associated example program for 
        details.
      - Added the ability to learn only non-negative weights to the 
        svm_c_linear_trainer.
   - Improved Integration with OpenCV: 
      - Updated the cv_image object so it works with cv::Mat as well as IplImage.
      - Added the toMat() routine for converting from a dlib style image to an
        OpenCV cv::Mat image.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Removed the dlib::sparse_vector namespace.  Everything from this namespace 
     was moved into the normal dlib:: namespace so that code which works with 
     both sparse and dense vectors is more cohesive.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in find_max_factor_graph_viterbi() which sometimes occurred when 
     the model order was larger than the number of variables.
   - Fixed a bug which caused a compiler error if you tried to call dot() on two 
     1x1 matrices which were statically dimensioned.

Other:
   - Improved existing documentation: added pictures of the gui widgets, 
     added documentation of the dlib::bridge protocol, and other minor 
     usability improvements.
</old>

<!-- *******************************************************************************  -->

<old name="17.46" date="Apr 11, 2012">
New Features:
   - Image Processing:
      - Added the option to make the features generated by poly_image rotationally 
        invariant. 
      - Added a set of routines for warping, scaling, and resizing images.
        See the new "Scaling and Rotating" section of the image processing
        documentation for details.
      - Added the heatmap() routine for converting an image into a heatmap.
   - Machine Learning
      - Updated the sequence labeling trainer to allow the user to set different 
        loss values for different labels.
      - Added the rls object.  It is an implementation of the linear recursive 
        least squares algorithm.
   - Added the get_option() routines which slightly simplify option parsing 
     from the command line and config files.
   - Added the 128bit version of Murmur hash.
   - Added the kalman_filter and rls_filter objects.  These are tools for 
     performing Kalman filtering and recursive least squares filtering.
   - Added the circular_buffer object. 

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - The poly_image generates slightly different features in this new release.
     Therefore, classifiers trained using the previous version will need to be
     retrained if they are switched to the new version of poly_image.
   - Changed the xcorr() functions so they take the complex conjugate of the right
     hand arguments if they are complex numbers.  This way they do a proper
     cross-correlation and also mirror the behavior of MATLAB.  However, this
     breaks backwards compatibility with the previous behavior of xcorr().
   - Previously, dlib included two versions of dlib::array.  However, to
     simplify the user interface, dlib now includes only the contiguous
     memory implementation of dlib::array.  This change should only affect
     you if you wrote code which assumed dlib::array::set_max_size() only
     allocated a small amount of RAM.  The new behavior is similar to the
     std::vector::reserve() routine.  That is, dlib::array::set_max_size()
     will allocate the requested amount of memory immediately.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug which caused certain matrix expressions to not compile
     when the BLAS bindings were enabled.  In particular, expressions which
     involved a 1x1 matrix sometimes didn't compile.

Other:
   - Made the matrix routines min(), max(), sum() and mean() work with 
     complex numbers. 
   - Turned the array object into a single implementation object.  Now arrays 
     can be created using the normal array&lt;type&gt; obj; syntax.  Additionally, 
     all extensions were merged into the array object. 
   - Added an example program which better documents how to create training
     data for the object detection tools as well as how this data can be used.
     See the train_object_detector.cpp example for details.

        See the structural_assignment_trainer and its associated example
        program for an introduction.
      - Added random projection based locality sensitive hashing tools.

        See the object_detector_ex.cpp example program for details.
   - Image Processing
      - Added sum_filter() and spatially_filter_image_separable_down()
      - New feature extractors: poly_image, nearest_neighbor_feature_image, and
        fine_hog_image
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the serialization format for rand objects.
   - Changed the order of arguments for the sequence_labeler's constructor.
   - Object Detection Changes
      - Some parts of the object detection tools have been refactored.  In particular, 
        the interfaces of the scan_image_pyramid and structural_object_detection_trainer 
        have been changed slightly to improve usability.
      - Made the test_box_overlap a little more flexible.  This change breaks
        backwards compatibility with the previous version though.
      - The hashed_feature_image object has been made more general.  It now 
        uses a user supplied hashing function rather than its own hashing 
        implementation.
      - Removed constness from the operator() member functions of the 
        object_detector.
   - Fixed improper normalization in the gaussian() functions.  The
     normalization constant was being computed incorrectly.
   - Sequence labeling feature extractors must now define a sequence_type
     typedef instead of sample_type.  This change allows the user to use any 
     type of sequence, not just std::vector objects.

Bug fixes:
   - Changed the add_probability() method of joint_probability_table so
     it does a saturating add rather than a normal add.  This ensures the
     probability value stays exactly &lt;= 1.  Previously, floating point
     rounding error could cause it to be slightly above 1 and would therefore
     cause some asserts to misfire during debugging mode.
   - The object_detector had code in it which limited the number of outputs
     to 100 rectangles.  This has been removed.
   - Fixed improper normalization in the gaussian() functions.  The
     normalization constant was being computed incorrectly.

Other:
   - dlib::rand can now generate Gaussian random numbers.
   - The structural_object_detection_trainer will now automatically setup
     appropriate non-max suppression parameters if the user doesn't supply them. 
   - The structural_object_detection_trainer has been optimized and now runs
     significantly faster than in previous dlib releases.
   - The tools folder containing htmlify, imglab, and mltool is now included
     in the dlib release archive files.  Previously, these tools were only 
     available directly from source control.

        sequence_labeler object and its associated example program for an 
        introduction.
   - Image processing:

      - Added the border_enumerator
   - Added the disjoint_subsets object, it is an implementation of the 
     union-find algorithm/disjoint-set data structure.
   - Added new matrix routines: conv(), conv_same(), conv_valid(), xcorr(),
     xcorr_same(), xcorr_valid(), and flip().
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed find_max_factor_graph_viterbi() so you can use run-time
     defined order and num_states parameters.

Bug fixes:
   - The last dlib release added a max_iterations parameter to the
     svm_c_linear_trainer and svm_c_ekm_trainer objects.  However,
     there was a bug which made them only do at most 16 iterations,
     which is too few to solve many problems.  This has been fixed.
   - Fixed a bug in is_const_type.  It didn't work for reference types.
   - Fixed a bug in the SQLite binding routine statement::get_column_as_text().  
     It didn't work correctly if the column contained a NULL.
   - Fixed a bug in find_max_factor_graph_viterbi() which occurred when a
     zero order model had negative factor values.

<old name="17.43" date="Oct 21, 2011">
New Features:
   - Two new routines for performing MAP inference in factor graphs:
      - For chain-structured graphs: find_max_factor_graph_viterbi()
      - For general graphs:          find_max_factor_graph_nmplp()
   - Image Processing
      - Added more tools for creating image pyramids.  See pyramid_down_5_4, 
        pyramid_down_4_3, and pyramid_down_3_2.
      - Added more image filtering and morphology functions.
      - Added a set of tools for creating sliding window classifiers:
         - Added the scan_image() routine.  It is a tool for sliding a set of 
           rectangles over an image space and finding the locations where the sum 
           of pixels in the rectangles exceeds a threshold.  Also added
           scan_image_pyramid, which is a tool for running scan_image() over an 
           image pyramid.
         - Added the structural_object_detection_trainer.  This is a tool which 
           formulates the sliding window classifier learning problem as an
           instance of structural SVM learning.
         - Added a variety of supporting tools and two object detection example 
           programs.
   - Added the following functions for computing statistics on vectors:
     mean_sign_agreement(), correlation(), covariance(), r_squared(),
     and mean_squared_error()
   - Added a C++ wrapper for SQLite (see the new database and statement objects)
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the interface to the ridge regression trainer objects so that they 
     report the entire set of leave-one-out prediction values rather than a 
     summary statistic like mean squared error.
   - Changed the serialization routine for bgr_pixels to store the pixels in BGR 
     order rather than RGB.
   - Changed the interface for the spatially_filter_image() routine to take the 
     filter as a matrix rather than C-array.  Also, now it won't force signed pixel 
     values to 0 if they go negative. 
   - Changed the test_regression_function() and cross_validate_regression_trainer()
     routines so they return both the MSE and R-squared values rather than just the
     MSE.
   - Changed suppress_non_maximum_edges() to use the L2 norm instead of L1 norm
     for measuring the strength of an edge since this produces a slightly better
     result.

Bug fixes:
   - The image_display didn't display overlay rectangles quite right.  If you zoomed
     in you could see that some of the pixels which are inside the rectangle were
     outside the overlay.  Specifically, the right column and bottom row was outside
     the overlay rectangle.  This has been fixed.  Now all pixels which are supposed
     to be part of a rectangle are drawn as being inside the overlay rectangle.
   - Fixed a bug pointed out by Martin Müllenhaupt which caused the windows socket
     code to not compile when used with the mingw-cross-env project.
   - Fixed a bug in the png_loader.  If you loaded an image with an alpha channel 
     into something without an alpha channel there were uninitialized values being 
     alpha blended into the image.
   - Fixed a bug in the cpp_tokenizer that only shows up on newer versions of gcc.  
     It wasn't tokenizing double quoted strings right.
   - Fixed a bug in spatially_filter_image() which showed up when using non-square 
     filters.  The bug would cause the edges of the output image to be incorrect.
   - Fixed a bug in the matrix class.  Expressions of the form mat *= mat(0) would
     evaluate incorrectly because the *= operator took the right hand side by reference
     and thus experienced an aliasing problem.  The other op= operators had similar
     problems and have also been fixed.
   - Fixed a bug pointed out by Justin Solomon which could cause the svr_trainer and
     svm_c_trainer to produce incorrect results in certain unusual cases.  

Other:
   - Added a more complete set of methods for converting between image space and 
     the downsampled hog grid used by hog_image.  Now you can convert from image 
     to hog in addition to hog to image.
   - Made the integral_image more general by making it templated on the type of 
     scalar used to store the sums.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Made get_pixel_intensity() more efficient.  However, the value returned
     is slightly different than it used to be for RGB pixel types.

Bug fixes:
   - Setup proper error handling for libpng in the png_loader.  Now if the PNG

   - Upgraded the pyramid_down function object so it can create color pyramids.  
     Also, added some functions which define the coordinate transforms between 
     different layers in an image pyramid.  
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the oca_problem interface to the oca optimizer.  Now the 
     optimization_status() function reports back the current risk and risk gap 
     in addition to the overall objective value and objective gap. 
   - Changed the stopping condition for the structured svm to the one suggested
     by the Joachims paper.  Now it stops when the risk gap is below a user
     supplied epsilon. 

Bug fixes:

Other:
   - Various usability improvements.
   - Improved the feature vector caching in the structural_svm_problem object.
   - Some objects were setup as multi-implementation objects but only had one 
     implementation.  I went through dlib and switched these to single implementation 
     objects.  So for example, to use the dlib crc32 module you used to declare an 
     object of type "crc32::kernel_1a" but now you can just say "crc32".  Note that 
     I did this change in a way that maintains backwards compatibility with previous 
     versions.  So crc32::kernel_1a is still allowed but that form is officially 
     deprecated.  The modified objects are as follows:

New Features:
   - Added a multiclass support vector machine.
   - Added a tool for solving the optimization problem associated with
     structural support vector machines.
   - Added new functions for dealing with sparse vectors: add_to(), 
     subtract_from(), max_index_plus_one(), fix_nonzero_indexing(), a
     more flexible dot(), and I renamed assign_dense_to_sparse() to assign() 
     and made it more flexible.
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Renamed max_index_value_plus_one() (a function for working with graphs) to 
     max_index_plus_one() so that it uses the same name as the essentially 
     identical function for working with sparse vectors.
   - I simplified the cross_validate_multiclass_trainer(), cross_validate_trainer(), 
     test_binary_decision_function(), and test_multiclass_decision_function()
     routines.  They now always return double matrices regardless of any other 
     consideration.  This only breaks previous code if you had been assigning
     the result into a float or long double matrix.
   - Renamed assign_dense_to_sparse() to assign()

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in load_libsvm_formatted_data().  I had forgotten to clear the 
     contents of the labels output vector before adding the loaded label data.  
   - Fixed a bug in the kernel_matrix() function.  It didn't compile when used 
     with sparse samples which were of type std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;&gt; &gt;.  
     Moreover, some of the trainers have a dependency on kernel_matrix() so this 
     fix makes those trainers also work with this kind of sparse sample.

Other:
   - Added a value_type typedef to matrix_exp so it's easier to write templates
     which operate on STL containers and matrix objects.

New Features:
   - Added the rr_trainer.  It is a version of krr_trainer which is optimized
     for use with the linear_kernel.
   - Added the approximate_distance_function() routine.  It is the core optimizer
     behind the reduced2() trainer adapter.  
   - Added an any_function which supports the same functionality as std::function 
     from the upcoming C++0x standard.  I added this so dlib can be modified to 
     easily support lambda functions while still being compilable with compilers 
     which don't support the new std::function.
   - Added overloads of all the GUI event handlers so you can use general functions 
     as callbacks (via any_function).  This way, if you have a C++0x compiler, you 
     can use lambda functions with the event handlers.
   - Added the split() function for splitting up strings.
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Improved the distance_function object by turning it into a properly 
     encapsulated class rather than just a simple struct.  I also added 
     overloaded +, -, *, and / operators for this object so you can do the 
     kind of arithmetic you would expect on an object which represents a 
     point in a vector space.  This breaks backwards compatibility with 
     the previous interface though as the member variables are now private.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a compile-time error in the kernel_matrix().
   - Fixed a bug in an assert in the spatially_filter_image() function.
   - Applied a patch from Nils Labugt which fixes a runtime bug in the gui_core

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
  - invalid_svm_nu_error has been renamed to invalid_nu_error.
  - Changed the pixel_traits so that signed grayscale pixel types are allowed.  
    This involved adding a few new fields to pixel_traits.  I also changed the 
    get_pixel_intensity() function so that its return value is of the same type 
    as the basic pixel type rather than always being unsigned long.
  - Removed the kernel_type typedef from the normalized function since this
    meta-object should be capable of working with non-kernel decision functions.
  - train_probabilistic_decision_function() no longer accepts column vectors of 
    samples and labels.  Now it only accepts std::vectors of samples and labels.  

Bug fixes:
  - Fixed a bug in the deserialization code for the sparse kernels.  The bug
    prevented code which used the deserialize() routine from compiling.

Other:
  - Changed the image display GUI widgets to use the assign_image_scaled() 
    function internally.  Now they will accept just about any image and 
    do the right thing.
  - Modified the type_safe_union so that you can call apply_to_contents() on const
    type_safe_unions.
  - Added serialization support for std::pair objects.
  - Made the train_probabilistic_decision_function() more general by making it work 
    with any kind of trainer object rather than only ones which produce 
    dlib::decision_function objects.  I also made it work with trainers that only 
    take std::vectors.

   - Added some functions to load and save LIBSVM formatted data files.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the definition of dlib's sparse vector format to require
     unsigned integral keys.  Having this requirement is nice because it 
     creates a simple correspondence between dense vector index values and 
     sparse vector keys.  The previous sparse vector definition was  
     excessively generic.
   - Renamed sparse_vector::dot_product() to sparse_vector::dot() so that

     the ability to compute projection error.
   - Added the random_subset_selector object.
   - Added the compute_mean_squared_distance() function.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Modified the logger's hook implementation so that it uses a special stream  
     buffer instead of an std::ostringstream.  This way logging doesn't cause 
     memory allocations.  This breaks backwards compatibility with the previous
     hook function API but only slightly.  The new hook functions must take a
     const char* instead of std::string.
   - Added the const_ret_type typedef to the matrix_exp.  It is now required that 
     all matrix expressions define this type.  This enables the expressions to 
     return elements by constant reference when appropriate rather than always 
     returning by value.  

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in the matrix BLAS bindings that caused BLAS to return an invalid
     argument error.  The error occurred when general matrix multiply expressions
     were transposed and didn't result in a square matrix.  E.g. mat = trans(a*b)
     where mat isn't square.
   - Fixed potential compile time bugs in the comparison operators for futures.
   - Added a missing check for division by zero in the SURF feature extractor.
   - Modified the find_min_single_variable() function so that it is more 
     robust when working with functions that are made up of a bunch of
     constant value strips.  Previously, these kinds of functions could
     cause the optimization to fail.

     reflects how these two classes are used within the library.
   - Changed the matrix_exp interface slightly.  This could only impact users

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a minor error in the LBFGS code.
   - Added a missing check for division by zero to the kcentroid, krls,

     this resulted in changes to the API.  See the optimization example program 
     for a discussion of the new API.

<old name="17.21" date="Aug 30, 2009">
New Features:
   - Added the ability to use a kernel cache to the batch_trainer object.  
   - svm_pegasos can now be configured to use two different lambda arguments
     for use with unbalanced data.
   - Added the reciprocal_max() and dot() matrix functions.
   - Added the bgr_pixel and cv_image objects so that OpenCV images can
     be easily used with dlib routines.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - I changed the batch trainers so that they always call clear() on the 
     trainer being used before training begins.  
   - Modified the svm_pegasos class so that the user can set independent lambda
     parameters for each class.  This breaks backwards compatibility with 
     the previous interface slightly and changes the serialization format
     of this class.
   - Split the vector_normalizer into a normal normalizer and a pca normalizer
     version. 
   - The zoomable_region widget now uses exponential rather than linear 
     zoom scaling since this is much more pleasing to use.  There is now 
     a new requirement on the zoom increment that it must be between 0 
     and 1.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in the cross_validate_trainer_threaded() function.  It could 
     deadlock if more than about 10 folds were requested.
   - Fixed the serialization functions for the normalized_function object.  
     They will now work with custom normalizer function objects.
   - Fixed a minor bug in the zoomable_region::set_min_zoom_scale() function.
     It didn't always end up zooming in a smooth sensible manner after this
     function was called.

Other:
   - Made the thread_function object more general.   It can now handle
     arbitrary functions of up to four arguments.

   - Upgraded the scoped_ptr so that it can handle array pointers as well
     as customer deleter functions.
   - Added overloads of the kernel_derivative object for all the kernels 
     in dlib.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Reworked the config_reader interface a little to make it easier to use.  
     In particular, I removed the enumerator over blocks in favor of a simple 
     get_blocks() function that just returns a std::vector of all the blocks.  
     I also removed the requires clauses on the block and key accessor functions 
     and instead made a request for a non-existent key/block result in a non-fatal 
     exception.  This way users can let the config reader perform a more natural 
     role in config file validation (by catching this exception and acting 
     accordingly).
   - It is now illegal to multiply matrices of size zero together. 

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed the gaussian() function used by the SURF code.  It wasn't computing 
     a properly weighted Gaussian function.
   - Fixed a few things in various parts of the code to avoid compiler errors 
     in certain use-cases.
   - Added a missing rethrow statement.  The xml parser would eat exceptions 
     thrown by event handlers rather than letting them propagate out as

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
    - Removed some extraneous get_kernel() functions from some of the 
      trainer adapter classes since they really aren't needed.  

Bug fixes:
    - Changed the socket read/write code so that it can handle a large 
      number ( > 2 billion) of bytes in I/O calls.
    - Added a missing type cast to the reciprocal() function to fix a compile
      time error you get when you use it with complex&lt;float&gt; type matrices.
    - Fixed a bug in the assign_border_pixels() and zero_border_pixels() functions.  
      Their contracts said there was no upper limit on the size of the border that 
      could be assigned/zeroed but the implementations failed to handle the case 
      where the border was bigger than the image.

Other:
    - Generally cleaned up the code and documentation here and there.
    - Added in Steven Van Ingelgem's patches to improve the usability of the
      HTTP server object.
    - Updated the load_bmp() function so that it is capable of reading BMP
      files that have been compressed with the RLE compression sometimes

     back to the server into the incoming data object given to the 
     server_http::on_request() handler.  This removes the content_length 
     field and replaces it with a string that contains the body of content

   - Changed the serialization format of the kcentroid and svm_pegasos
     objects
   - By default, the kcentroid now keeps the most linearly independent 
     dictionary vectors rather than the newest

Bug fixes:

Other:
   - Split the algorithms documentation page into three pages, algorithms,
     machine learning, and bayes nets.
   - Merged in Steven Van Ingelgem's patch to cleanup the HTTP server and
     add new functionality.  This breaks backwards compatibility with the
     previous on_request() interface but it is easy to update old code and
     it is now much cleaner and easier to use.
   - Changed the kcentroid so that you can tell it to keep the most linearly

   - Fixed dlib::abs() so that it returns the right type when used
     with complex matrices.
   - Fixed a race condition in the logger object.  It was missing a needed call
     to unregister_thread_end_handler().  What could happen in some scenarios is,
     during program termination, a global part of the logger object could be destructed
     when it still had outstanding thread end handlers registered to it.  

Other:

        matrices like in Matlab.
      - Added a new template argument to the matrix object that allows the
        user to select the memory layout.  Also added a row_major_layout 
        and column_major_layout.
      - The matrix object can now be initialized using a comma separated
        list of values.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the fatal_error exception class so that it aborts your program
     and prints a message if you try to construct it more than once since 
     doing so indicates that you ignored the first fatal error.
   - The way matrix expressions work in the library has been changed
     since the last release.  So if you created custom matrix expressions 
     then they will need to be updated to use the new matrix expression stuff.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a minor bug in how the zoomable_region widget drew itself after 
     a resize in some cases.
   - Fixed a problem with draw_line where it didn't always redraw the line 
     properly.

Other:
   - A lot of the matrix code has been refactored and optimized.  The matrix
     object will now introduce temporary objects when doing so results in
     better performance.  I also added a simple system for binding 
     arbitrary matrix expressions to optimized BLAS routines. 
   - Cleaned up the vector and point classes.  Now there is only one class, 
     the vector class, and it is capable of representing everything the old 
     vector and point class could.  I also added code to make sure the 
     vector class does the appropriate type promotions when vector objects

     you have made your own style objects.
   - Changed the serialization format of the krls, kcentroid, and
     directed_graph_drawer objects.  Note that is also means that the
     files saved by previous versions of the bayes_net_gui_ex program
     won't load with the current version.

<old name="17.2" date="Apr 21, 2008">
New Features:
   - GUI Related
      - Added the scrollable_region widget
      - Added the text_grid widget
      - Added an event to the text_field so you can tell when the
        user modifies it.
      - Added the fit_to_contents() function to the tabbed_display 
        widget.
   - Bayesian Network Related
      - Added the node_first_parent_assignment(), node_next_parent_assignment(), 
        and node_cpt_filled_out() functions.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Reverted the change in 17.0 where I made drawable::lastx and 
     drawable::lasty not match the current location of the mouse inside
     the on_mouse_move() event.  I changed this back to how it was before,
     so now lastx and lasty represent the most current record of where
     the mouse is in *all* events.
   - Changed the functions that control text color in the label and text_field
     widgets to use rgb_pixel objects.  Also added a function to set the
     background color of a text_field.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in the bayesian_network_join_tree object that caused it to
     compute incorrect results for some networks.
   - GUI Related
      - Fixed a minor bug in the cursor drawing of the text_field
        gui widget.
      - Fixed a bug in the compute_cursor_rect() function.  It would return an
        incorrectly positioned rectangle for 0 length strings.
      - Changed the way wchar_t is handled in the serialize.h file.  Now
        everything should compile correctly in visual studio regardless of how
        you set the /Zc:wchar_t compiler option.
      - Fixed a bug in the menu_bar widget.  One of the members wasn't being 
        initialized when it needed to be.
      - Fixed a bug in the tabbed_display where it didn't redraw itself
        correctly after it was moved by set_pos()

Other:
   - Changed the xml parser so that it counts line numbers
     from the start of the input stream instead of from the
     root tag.
   - Changed the xml parser so that you will only get the fatal_error
     event once if it occurs.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in the tooltip widget that was triggered when calling
     its member functions without calling set_tooltip_text().  This also 
     fixed a bug in the button object that triggered when calling some button

  - GUI related
    - Added a popup_menu widget
    - Added a menu_bar widget
    - Added a tooltip widget
    - Added a user selectable style to the gui button.
    - Added the draw_rounded_rectangle() and fill_gradient_rounded() functions
    - Added the mouse_over_event object to the base_widgets and made the 
      button_action inherit from it.
    - Added the drawable::next_free_user_event_number() function 
  - matrix and geometry:
    - Added a size() function to matrix_exp and matrix_ref objects.
    - Added a class that represents 2D points 
    - Added the following matrix functions:
      - squared(), cubed(), get_rect(), a subm() function that takes 
        rectangles, and normalize() 
    - Added the following rectangle functions:
      - area(), centered_rect(), translate_rect(), move_rect(), resize_rect(),
        resize_rect_height(), resize_rect_width(), and nearest_point() 

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
  - Renamed atom() to array_to_matrix()
  - Moved the rectangle object from the gui_core into a new geometry folder  
    (only matters if you were directly including the rectangle file)
  - Moved the vector object into the geometry folder.  Also removed the kernel_1a
    stuff.  So there is now only one possible vector implementation.
  - Changed the default position for a rectangle to (0,0) instead of (1,1)
  - Added edge data to the directed_graph.  This breaks backwards compatibility 
    with the previous serialization format for directed_graphs.
  - GUI related:
    - Changed the base_window::on_keydown event signature so that it now
      reports more keyboard modifier keys (e.g. alt)
    - Made the functions for drawing on canvas objects take points and pixels 
      instead of just a bunch of integers.  Also changed the order of the
      arguments so that the canvas comes first, followed by the location
      to draw on, then what to draw.
    - Moved the canvas drawing functions into the gui_widgets/canvas_drawing.h 
      file.
    - Modified the drawable_window so that the drawable::lastx and drawable::lasty
      fields are updated after calls to on_mouse_move.  This way the x and y that
      go into the on_mouse_move actually tell you something.

Bug fixes:
  - Fixed a bug in the floating point serialization code.  It 
    didn't handle NaN or infinities correctly.
  - Fixed a bug in the win32 version of the gui_core component.  It was 
    possible that calling set_size(), set_pos(), or set_title() could cause 
    the program to deadlock.
  - Made the load_bmp() function more robust in the face of weirdly 
    written BMP files.
  - Modified the draw_circle() and draw_solid_circle() functions so that they
    only touch each canvas pixel once.  This avoids messing up alpha blending
    if an rgb_alpha_pixel is used.  

Other:
  - Removed the old win32 only gui code in the dlib/gui folder. 
  - Changed the default GUI font to a nicer Sans Serif font

     Now it can take proper function objects as well as normal function
     pointers.
   - Added the probabilistic_decision_function object and svm_nu_train_prob() 
     function.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the svm train functions so that the cache_size argument
     now measures the max number of megabytes of memory to use rather
     than number of kernel matrix rows to cache.  It's default
     value is now 200MB.
   - changed the type typedef in the SVM kernel function objects to
     be named sample_type instead of type. 

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in the trim, rtrim, and ltrim functions.  They
     didn't return empty strings when the input string contained all
     trim characters.
   - Fixed a bug in the decision_function's copy constructor

Other:
   - Added an optimization to the working set selection for the svm training code.
     Now the algorithm will prefer to select indices that are in the kernel 
     matrix cache when possible.
   - Fixed a problem with the chm documentation file where many of the links
     didn't work.
   - Made the support vector functions capable of operating with floats, doubles,
     and long doubles instead of just the double type.

   - Added some push/pop_back() functions to the array object that are similar
     to the ones in the std::vector.
   - Added the std_vector_c class that wraps std::vector and checks its 
     function's preconditions.
   - Added the polynomial_kernel object for use with the svm algorithm.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the svm_nu_cross_validate() function to return a vector
     of both the +1 and -1 cross validation accuracies.

Bug fixes:

<old name="16.3" date="Feb 12, 2008">
New Features:
   - Added memory manager support to the matrix object.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Made the assign_pixel() function saturate grayscale values bigger
     than the target pixel type can handle.  Previously it would just 
     truncate the numbers.
   - Removed rand_kernel_1 and rand_kernel_2 because they gave very 
     inferior results compared to rand_kernel_3.  I then renamed
     rand_kernel_3 to rand_kernel_1.
   - Renamed rand::get_random_number() to get_random_8bit_number() and also 
     added a get_random_16bit_number() and get_random_32bit_number()
   - Added a checksum to compress_stream_kernel_1 and kernel_2.  This 
     breaks backwards compatibility with the previous versions.  That is,
     the new implementations will complain that decompression fails if 
     you give them data compressed with the old non-checksum version of
     the compression routines. 
   - Removed the width() and height() functions from the array2d object.  
     Now only the equivalent nc() and nr() member functions remain.
   - Changed array2d::set_size(width,height) to set_size(num_rows, num_cols).  
     That is, I switched the order of the two arguments to this function.
     The reason for doing this is to make it have the same form as the
     set_size() member of the matrix object.  This way the usage of the
     set_size() member for these two very similar data structures is 
     the same.  Hopefully this will reduce confusion rather than 
     make things worse.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in the image_widget.  It didn't repaint the screen
     all the way if you gave it a smaller image to display.
   - Fixed a bug in the cat() function that caused the state of the queue
     to be broken if you called cat with an empty queue.
   - Made the queue_sort_1 use a better sorting algorithm.  In particular, it 
     will not sort slowly for nearly sorted data.
   - Fixed a bug in the queue_kernel_2 object that caused it to not work 
     correctly with the non-default memory managers.

Other:
   - Added example code for the member_function_pointer as well as the matrix 
     object.
   - Added some more regression tests and made some of the longer running 
     ones execute a lot quicker.
   - Made the unit test suite easier to use.  Now tests just throw an exception 
     to indicate an error rather than returning an error code.
   - Added an example program for the multi-layer perceptron neural network.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - The dlib/all_console.cpp and dlib/all_gui.cpp files have been deprecated
     in favor of a new file.  Now to build with dlib you simply add 
     dlib/all/source.cpp to your project regardless of what type of project
     you are building.
   - The GUI program entry point, winmain(), has been removed.  You can now use 
     the normal main() entry point or some other non-standard entry point 
     provided by your compiler.
   - Renamed directed_graph::node::item to directed_graph::node::data

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the default logging level from LNONE to LERROR
   - Renamed the ASSERT macro to DLIB_ASSERT and CASSERT to DLIB_CASSERT.  
     This rename avoids a conflict with a macro inside MFC.
   - Changed the logger so that settings are inherited when a new logger
     is instantiated rather than just having the new logger use the 
     default settings.
   - Removed the logger::clear() function since it no longer really
     makes sense given the above change.
   - Removed the get_main_thread_id() function and replaced it with the
     is_dlib_thread() function.

Bug fixes:
   - Pushed some things into cpp files because doing so avoids build and/or 
     runtime errors on some platforms.   

Other:

New Features:
   - Added the covariance() function
   - Added the rgb_alpha_pixel pixel type and modified all relevant functions to

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
  - The GUI changes that are non-backwards compatible:
       - The alpha parameter is now an unsigned char instead of unsigned int
         and its range is now 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 256.
       - The image_widget no longer has any member functions dealing with
         alpha values.  If you want to use alpha blending you just give it an
         image that has an alpha channel.  The same goes for draw_image().
  - There are now more fields in the pixel_traits template.  So if you were 
    defining your own pixels before you will need to update your pixel_traits 
    specializations.

Bug fixes:
  - Made some functions non-inline and put some things on the stack 
    instead of heap.  Doing this avoids some problems with certain 
    kinds of builds in visual studio.

        a static dimension and a dynamic dimension.  E.g. matrix&lt;float,0,10&gt;
        is now legal and declares a matrix with a fixed number of columns(10) 
        and a variable number of rows.
      - Added the equal() function to compare two matrices of floating

  - Added the configure_loggers_from_file() function which allows you to
    easily configure all logger objects using a textual configuration
    file.

New Features:

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in the POSIX version of the hostname_to_ip() function. It was
     screwy if you asked for more than the first IP address (the same address
     might be returned more than once).
   - Fixed a bug in the pipe object's timeout functions.  The timeouts weren't
     working correctly.

Other:

</old>

<!-- *******************************************************************************  -->

<old name="15.3" date="Jun 25, 2007">
New Features:
   - Added the wait_for_num_blocked_dequeues(), enable_enqueue(), 
     disable_enqueue(), and is_enqueue_enabled() functions to the pipe object.
   - The pipe object can now be used with a zero length buffer.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - There is no longer a pipe::kernel_1a_c typedef since the pipe 
     no longer has any requirements to check (due to the change of allowing
     zero length buffer sizes)

Bug fixes:

Other:
   - Made the ASSERT and CASSERT macros call dlib_assert_breakpoint() when they 
     fail.  This way you can easily set a breakpoint on them in a debugging
     tool by breaking on calls to this new function.
   - Fixed some typos and unclear parts of the pipe spec.

<old name="15.2" date="Jun 11, 2007">
New Features:
   - Added a thread safe version of the config_reader object (in the form of an 
     extension to the config_reader)
   - Added the wait_until_empty() function to the pipe object.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Removed the connection::close() and listener::close() functions.  They have
     been replaced by destructors.  To upgrade old code all you have to do is 
     replace statements of the form "object->close();" with "delete object;".  
     Both statements do exactly the same thing.  However, for connection objects, 
     you should probably be using the close_gracefully() function instead.

Bug fixes:
   - Removed a potential compile time error in the dng image format handling code.
   - Fixed a bug in the bigint object.  The destructor was using "delete" 
     when it should have been using "delete []"
   - Fixed a resource leak in the POSIX version hostname_to_ip()
   - Fixed a significant memory leak in memory_manager_kernel_1
   - Fixed a memory leak that could occur in memory_manager_kernel_2
     and memory_manager_kernel_3 when the constructor for the object
     being constructed threw an exception.
   - Added a missing delete statement to plug a memory leak
     in the md5 computation code.
   - Fixed an uninitialized variable warning from valgrind 
     (in lz77_buffer/lz77_buffer_kernel_2.h).  I think this could
     also potentially result in an error when decoding data but I'm not totally
     sure.  But either way it is fixed now.
   - Changed a call to memcpy to memmove in the sockstreambuf_kernel_2 
     implementation since the copy could potentially be of overlapped memory.  

Other:
   - Changed the connection::read() and connection::write() functions to take
     longs instead of unsigned longs as the buffer sizes.  They also now 
     return longs instead of ints.  This should be a backwards compatible change.
   - Started using the valgrind tool to check for memory errors in the project and
     found a few things.  Very nice tool :)

New Features:
   - Added the multithreaded_object extension to the threads API
   - Added the load_dng() and save_dng() functions which can load and store
     the DNG lossless compressed image format (which I just made up).

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the serialization format for bool to use a 1 byte code rather than 2 
     bytes.  So this breaks compatibility with the old format.

Bug fixes:
   - The serialization for bool didn't always work right.  This is now fixed.

<old name="15.0" date="May 16, 2007">
New Features:
   - New faster version of the bigint object (bigint_kernel_2) that uses
     the Fast Fourier Transform to perform multiplications.
   - The base_window can now be an "undecorated" window.  This new type is suitable
     for making things like popup menus and the like.
   - Added the on_focus_lost() event to the base_window object
   - Added the on_focus_gained() event to the base_window object
   - Added the on_window_moved() event to the base_window object
   - Added the get_pos() function to the base_window object
   - Updated the gui_widgets's drawable interface stuff to support the three
     new event types and the new window type.
   - Added the drawable::draw_rectangle() function
   - Added serialization support for std::complex.
   - Added the assign_image() function

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Removed the color arguments from the drawable_window object's constructor and
     added a new boolean argument (if it is an undecorated window or not).  This
     probably won't break any code but if it does you should get a compiler error
     about it.
   - Made it so you must disable the events in the destructor for your
     drawable gui widgets.  Doing so avoids potential race conditions when
     destructing drawable objects.
   - Made it so that you are required to call close_window() in a window object's 
     destructor.  This avoids a potential race condition.

Bug fixes:
   - Added a workaround for a bug in MinGW that caused the regression test suite
     to crash when compiled with -O3.
   - Fixed a potential bug in the X Windows version of the gui_core component. 
      Added an extra XFlush() to end_program() because without it a 
      program can crash when calling end_program() in certain instances.
   - The spec for the pipe object said that objects you enqueue into it
     had an "initial value for their type" after the function completes. This
     is incorrect, they are swapped into the pipe so they have an undefined
     value afterwards.  I fixed the spec for the pipe to say this.
   - Fixed a bug in the font rendering functions in the gui_widgets
     component.  It could cause a segmentation fault sometimes.
   - Fixed some potential deadlocks in the windows version of the gui_core
     component.
   - Fixed a bug in the rsignaler object.  When you called wait() or 
     wait_or_timeout() it only unlocked the associated rmutex once (it could be 
     locked more than once and thus might cause a deadlock since the thread
     calling wait() wouldn't actually unlock the mutex in this case).  
   - Fixed the initialize_array() function in memory_manger_kernel_3 to be 
     exception safe.  Previously if an exception occurred while creating
     an array then a resource leak was created.

Other:
   - Changed the package format for the library somewhat.  The examples are now 
     located in their own top level folder.  Additionally, the HTML version of the 
     documentation also comes in the same archive as the source rather than in a 
     separate download.
   - Started using major and minor version numbers rather than just major ones.

New Features:
   - Added operator&lt;&lt; and operator&gt;&gt; iostream operators to the vector object. 

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the xml_parser's document_handler interface:  
     made empty element tags (&lt;like_this/&gt;) trigger the end_element() callback
     and removed the is_empty bool from start_element().

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a potential race condition between the destruction of the thread pool
     and the "program ending handlers" stuff.

   - Added nr() and nc() to the array2d object.
   - Added the shutdown_connection() function to the iostream extension
     to the server object.
   - Added the timer_kernel_2 implementation which is a version of the timer object
     that is more efficient in its allocation of threads.
   - Added the timeout object.
   - There is now a CMakeLists.txt file located in the dlib folder.  See
     dlib/examples/CMakeLists.txt and dlib/test/CMakeLists.txt for examples 
     that use CMake to build projects using this library.
   - Added the register_program_ending_handler() function to the threading API.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Removed the config_reader::get_blocks() function.  Use the
     new enumerable interface for the config_reader instead.
   - The array2d object now uses longs instead of unsigned longs to report
     its dimensions and access its elements.  
   - Added a uint64 to the on_connect() callback in the iostream 
     extension to the server object.
   - timer::set_delay_time() now throws and timer::start() now may throw 
     std::bad_alloc.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in end_program().  In X Windows it might not cause the
     program to end right away if it was called from outside the event
     handling thread.
   - Fixed a bug in the implementation of the timeout part of the
     close_gracefully() function.

Other:

   - Made the member_function_pointer copyable and also added operator== and !=

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Made the vector object templated so you can use types other than double with it.
     But now you 
     have to specify what type you want to use which is slightly different.
   - The asc_pair_remover and asc_remover abstract classes now take a third template 
     argument.  I highly doubt this effects any code outside the library but it is 
     possible.
 
Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in the base_window::set_size() function.  If you specified a size
     of (0,0) it caused your program to error out.  This has now been fixed.
   - Fixed a bug in the scroll_bar widget.
   - Fixed a bug in save_bmp().  For some image sizes it would output a goofy 
     looking skewed image.

Other:
   - Switched everything that used to call operator&lt; directly to instead use 
     std::less or to take a template argument that provides a compare functor that
     defaults to std::less.

New Features:
   - Added the assign_pixel() function
   - Added the hsi pixel type 
   - Added the save_bmp() function
   - Added the static_switch template

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed how the config_reader works.  It now has a more powerful syntax and 
     improved interface.  Converting any old code to use the new version should be 
     simple since the new file syntax is very nearly backwards compatible with the 
     old syntax.  (i.e. You probably won't have to change anything about your 
     config files)
   - Renamed the dlib/image_loader.h file to dlib/image_io.h since it now includes
     the image saver stuff.
   - Renamed the pixel struct to rgb_pixel
   - Renamed pixel_traits::color to pixel_traits::rgb
   - Renamed pixel_traits::scalar to pixel_traits::grayscale
 
Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in the load_bmp() function.  It would load 24bit bmp files 
     incorrectly.
   - Changed the logger so that it won't deadlock if you write something similar to
     my_log &lt;&lt; LINFO &lt;&lt; function_that_also_logs();.  Although this is a
     dumb thing to do.  But even so, it shouldn't deadlock.
   - Fixed a potential linking problem with the vector object.

Other:
   - I decided I'm not going to support Borland v5.5.1 anymore.  There are just too 
     many bugs in this compiler.  It is very old at this point so I don't see this 
     being a big deal. 
   - Made the drawable::draw_image() and load_bmp() functions able to handle images
     of any type of pixel.
   - Pulled the imaging, algorithmic and metaprogramming stuff out of the 
     miscellaneous section of the web page and gave them all their own sections.

New Features:
   - Added a logger header that prints the date and time.
   - Added the LTRACE logging level
   - Added a buffered implementation of sockstreambuf. 

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the specs to say that sockstreambuf may be buffered.  
     sockstreambuf_kernel_1 is still just as it always has been though.  So all old 
     code will still work just as it always has.  But all the same, the specs have 
     been changed and now allow for an implementation that is not 100% backwards 
     compatible.
   - rand_kernel_2 now emits a different string of random numbers.  
 
Bug fixes:
   - Changed the logger object's implementation to not try to register
     a thread end handler for the main program thread anymore.  This was 
     technically a bug according to the spec but it actually did end up
     working the way it was supposed to.  But even so, it shouldn't have 
     been doing that.
   - Changed binary_search_tree_kernel_1 so that it avoids a bug in the version of
     gcc on SuSE Enterprise Linux 9.
   - Fixed a bug in the rand_kernel_2 implementation.  It wasn't giving good

     a thread with a member function.
   - Added the register_thread_end_handler() function to the threading kernel API. 
   - Added memory_manager_kernel_3

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the meaning of the memory_manager_global::get_number_of_allocations() 
     function because the previous definition of it didn't really make sense for 
     this object.
   - Changed the threading API to wait for all outstanding threads to terminate 
     before allowing the program to end.  It used to just let the OS trash those 
     threads when main() ended but this isn't a safe or portable thing to do.  I 
     used to assume the user would make sure all their threads were done and had 
     cleaned up whatever they were doing before main() ended but this is too much 
     of a burden on the end user.  So now the library will wait for your threads to
     end.  You still need to have some way of telling them it is time to stop though.
 
Bug fixes:

     slightly off according to the specification of a timer object.

Other:
   - The byte_order object is now capable of flipping entire arrays.

   - Switched the reference_counter object back to not using the memory_manager.
     I realized it isn't safe for this object to use the memory_manager since 
     it could result in memory_managers freeing each other's allocations.
   - I redefined the pixel_traits template.  It is now a lot simpler and more

     functions to the drawable interface. 

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Made the radio_button and check_box widgets pass references to themselves
     when they call their click handlers.  
   - Switched the sync_extension to use the rmutex and rsignaler objects
     rather than the normal non-reentrant ones. ( Chances are that old
     code that used this will still compile fine anyway. )
   - Changed the return type of rand::get_random_number() to be an 
     unsigned char.  I also changed both the implementations of 
     rand because they weren't very good at all. 
   - Changed the functions related to drawing strings in the font class.
   - Changed the drawable's rectangle to default to being empty
     rather than being a single point.  Most code should not notice
     the difference.
 
Bug fixes:
   - The event handlers in gui_widgets/drawable.h were private.  They
     should be protected.  This is now fixed.
   - Fixed a bug in the way the scroll_bar was drawn when it was
     the HORIZONTAL type.
   - Changed how the thread pool destructs itself when the program 
     is ending.  Previously it was possible to get an error on
     NetBSD when the program was ending.  This is now fixed.
   - The functions related to setting the jump size in the scroll_bar
     widget were private.  They are now public.
   - There was a bug in the MS Windows version of the gui_core component
     where the members of the base_window would not work if called from
     within the on_window_close() event.  This has now been fixed.
   - Made the set_pos() function work right for the mouse_tracker widget.
   - Fixed a bug in the base64 object where the string "" could potentially 
     be decoded incorrectly.
   - Made the global swap function for crc32_kernel_1 inline.  This fixes a

     again compiles under gcc 2.95.  But some things don't and I currently
     don't plan on making them work because it involves hackish workarounds
     of 2.95's bugs. 
   - Changed the compress_stream_kernel_1 object so that it will detect data
     corruptions better.  This change will prevent it from correctly decompressing
     data that was compressed with a previous version and has an uncompressed size
     greater than about 20,000 bytes.
   - There is a new cpp file you need to compile:  dlib/error.cpp
   - Moved all the regression testing stuff into the dlib/test folder and made
     a nicer test driver to run them.

New Features:
    - Created the byte_orderer object.
    - Created the mouse_tracker gui widget.
    - The sliding_buffer object is now enumerable and serializable.
    - Added the get_filesystem_roots() function to the dir_nar component.
    - Added the create_directory() function to the misc_api component.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
    - The ASSERT macro is now only enabled if DEBUG or ENABLE_ASSERTS
      is defined.
 
Bug fixes:
    - Fixed a minor bug in the cmd_line_parser object.  If you gave
      an option such as --option=arg when option didn't take any 
      arguments it could hang your program.
    - Fixed a bug in wait_or_timeout() in the posix version of the threading 
      api.  The time to wait for was being calculated incorrectly and could 
      result in an excessive number of spurious returns.
    - Fixed a minor bug in the on_keydown() event for windows.
      I had it set such that the shift and ctrl bools would be false
      if they were the actual keys being pressed.  This isn't what the
      specs say should happen but I had a comment in the windows code
      that made it clear that I did it on purpose.  Go figure :)
      This is now fixed. 

Other:
    - Improved the cpp_tokenizer object's ability to recognize numerical 
      constants.
    - Improved the text_field gui widget.
    - There are now two assert macros.  One called ASSERT
      and another CASSERT.  They both do the same thing but ASSERT
      is only enabled when DEBUG or ENABLE_ASSERTS is defined.
      All the old ASSERT statements were changed to CASSERT statements.

    - Added the tabbed_display GUI widget 
    - Added the widget_group GUI widget 
    - Added the named_rectangle GUI widget 
    - Added the pixel_traits template

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
    - The default maximum size for an array object is now 0 rather than 
      20,000.
Bug fixes:

Other:
    - made the cpp_pretty_printer a little better about how it handles
      C style code.  Also added support for /*!A html_anchor_name !*/ 
      style comments.
</old>

<old name="2006-01-31.02">
New Features:
    - Created the array2d object.
    - Created the base64 object.
    - Created the pixel struct.
    - Created the load_bmp() function which can load a BMP image file
      into an array2d object of pixels.
    - Created the drawable::draw_image() function

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
    - In the drawable interface I made the z order a long rather
      than unsigned long.
    - The cpp_tokenizer object now has a NUMBER token type.
    - removed the get_ prefix from functions in the cmd_line_parser 
      and cmd_line_parser_option objects.  Also changed the 
      cmd_line_parser_option::operator[] function to a normal member 
      function called argument(). 
 
Bug fixes:

Other:
    - cpp_pretty_printer now colors numeric literals a shade of yellow.

<old name="2006-01-15.03">
New Features:
    - Created the member_function_pointer object.
    - Created the button_action object.
    - Created the arrow_button object.
    - Created the check_box object.
    - Created the radio_button object.
    - Created the scroll_bar object.
    - More drawing functions to draw various things
      onto a canvas object.
    - Added enable/disable functions to the 
      drawable interface.
  
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
    - The gui widgets are no longer templated at the 
      class level.
    - The drawable object's constructor now takes a 
      bit set rather than a bunch of bools to tell it
      which events to enable.
    - I changed the names of some of the functions in the
      gui_widgets component so that they all reflected a 
      uniform naming style.
 
Bug fixes:
    - Fixed a minor bug in the cpp_tokenizer.  
    - Minor bug in the timer object. See change log for 
      details.

Other:
    - Made the timer object a little more robust
