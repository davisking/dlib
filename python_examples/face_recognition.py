#   This example shows how to use dlib's face recognition tool.  This tool maps
#   an image of a human face to a 128 dimensional vector space where images of
#   the same person are near to each other and images from different people are
#   far apart.  Therefore, you can perform face recognition by mapping faces to
#   the 128D space and then checking if their Euclidean distance is small
#   enough. 
#
#   When using a distance threshold of 0.6, the dlib model obtains an accuracy
#   of 99.38% on the standard LFW face recognition benchmark, which is
#   comparable to other state-of-the-art methods for face recognition as of
#   February 2017. This accuracy means that, when presented with a pair of face
#   images, the tool will correctly identify if the pair belongs to the same
#   person or is from different people 99.38% of the time.
#
#   Finally, for an in-depth discussion of how dlib's tool works you should
#   refer to the C++ example program dnn_face_recognition_ex.cpp and the
#   attendant documentation referenced therein.

#
# COMPILING/INSTALLING THE DLIB PYTHON INTERFACE
#   You can install dlib using the command:
#       pip install dlib
#
#   Alternatively, if you want to compile dlib yourself then go into the dlib
#   root folder and run:
#       python setup.py install
#   or
#       python setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS
#   if you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions, since this makes some
#   things run faster.  This code will also use CUDA if you have CUDA and cuDNN
#   installed.
#
#   Compiling dlib should work on any operating system so long as you have
#   CMake and boost-python installed.  On Ubuntu, this can be done easily by
#   running the command:
#       sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev cmake
#
#   Also note that this example requires scikit-image which can be installed
#   via the command:
#       pip install scikit-image
#   Or downloaded from http://scikit-image.org/download.html.

        # explain a little, the 3rd argument tells the code how many times to
        # jitter/resample the image.  When you set it to 100 it executes the
        # face descriptor extraction 100 times on slightly modified versions of
        # the face and returns the average result.  You could also pick a more
        # middle value, such as 10, which is only 10x slower but still gets an
        # LFW accuracy of 99.3%.
