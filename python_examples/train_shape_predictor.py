#   This example program shows how to use dlib's implementation of the paper:
#   One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees by
#   Vahid Kazemi and Josephine Sullivan, CVPR 2014
#
#   In particular, we will train a face landmarking model based on a small
#   dataset and then evaluate it.  If you want to visualize the output of the
#   trained model on some images then you can run the
#   face_landmark_detection.py example program with predictor.dat as the input
#   model.
#
#   It should also be noted that this kind of model, while often used for face
#   landmarking, is quite general and can be used for a variety of shape
#   prediction tasks.  But here we demonstrate it only on a simple face
#   landmarking task.
#
# COMPILING THE DLIB PYTHON INTERFACE
#   Dlib comes with a compiled python interface for python 2.7 on MS Windows. If
#   you are using another python version or operating system then you need to
#   compile the dlib python interface before you can use this file.  To do this,
#   run compile_dlib_python_module.bat.  This should work on any operating
#   system so long as you have CMake and boost-python installed.
#   On Ubuntu, this can be done easily by running the command:
#       sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev cmake
#
#   Also note that this example requires scikit-image which can be installed
#   via the command:
#       pip install -U scikit-image
#   Or downloaded from http://scikit-image.org/download.html.

# in great detail.  However, here I'm just setting three of them
# differently than their default values.  I'm doing this because we
# have a very small dataset.  In particular, setting the oversampling
# to a high amount (300) effectively boosts the training set size, so
# that helps this example.

# trained it on a very small dataset so the accuracy is not extremely high, but
# it's still doing quite good.  Moreover, if you train it on one of the large
