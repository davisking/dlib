# This example shows how to use the correlation_tracker from the dlib Python
# library.  This object lets you track the position of an object as it moves
# from frame to frame in a video sequence.  To use it, you give the
# correlation_tracker the bounding box of the object you want to track in the
# current video frame.  Then it will identify the location of the object in
# subsequent frames.
#
# In this particular example, we are going to run on the
# video sequence that comes with dlib, which can be found in the
# examples/video_frames folder.  This video shows a juice box sitting on a table
# and someone is waving the camera around.  The task is to track the position of
# the juice box as the camera moves around.
#
#
# COMPILING/INSTALLING THE DLIB PYTHON INTERFACE
#   You can install dlib using the command:
#       pip install dlib
#
#   Alternatively, if you want to compile dlib yourself then go into the dlib
#   root folder and run:
#       python setup.py install
#   or
#       python setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS
#   if you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions, since this makes some
#   things run faster.  
#
#   Compiling dlib should work on any operating system so long as you have
#   CMake and boost-python installed.  On Ubuntu, this can be done easily by
#   running the command:
#       sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev cmake
#
#   Also note that this example requires scikit-image which can be installed
#   via the command:
#       pip install scikit-image
#   Or downloaded from http://scikit-image.org/download.html.
