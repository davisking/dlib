# This example shows how to use dlib to learn to do sequence segmentation.  In
# a sequence segmentation task we are given a sequence of objects (e.g. words in
# a sentence) and we are supposed to detect certain subsequences (e.g. the names
# of people).  Therefore, in the code below we create some very simple training
# sequences and use them to learn a sequence segmentation model.  In particular,
# our sequences will be sentences represented as arrays of words and our task
# will be to learn to identify person names.  Once we have our segmentation
# model we can use it to find names in new sentences, as we will show.
#
# COMPILING/INSTALLING THE DLIB PYTHON INTERFACE
#   You can install dlib using the command:
#       pip install dlib
#
#   Alternatively, if you want to compile dlib yourself then go into the dlib
#   root folder and run:
#       python setup.py install
#   or
#       python setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS
#   if you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions, since this makes some
#   things run faster.  
#
#   Compiling dlib should work on any operating system so long as you have
#   CMake and boost-python installed.  On Ubuntu, this can be done easily by
#   running the command:
#       sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev cmake
#

# The sequence segmentation models we work with in this example are chain
# structured conditional random field style models.  Therefore, central to a
# sequence segmentation model is some method for converting the elements of a
# sequence into feature vectors. That is, while you might start out representing
# your sequence as an array of strings, the dlib interface works in terms of
# arrays of feature vectors.  Each feature vector should capture important
# information about its corresponding element in the original raw sequence.  So
# in this example, since we work with sequences of words and want to identify
# names, we will create feature vectors that tell us if the word is capitalized
# or not.  In our simple data, this will be enough to identify names.
# Therefore, we define sentence_to_vectors() which takes a sentence represented
# as a string and converts it into an array of words and then associates a
# feature vector with each word.
def sentence_to_vectors(sentence):
    # Create an empty array of vectors
    vects = dlib.vectors()
    for word in sentence.split():
        # Our vectors are very simple 1-dimensional vectors.  The value of the
        # single feature is 1 if the first letter of the word is capitalized and
        # 0 otherwise.
        if word[0].isupper():
            vects.append(dlib.vector([1]))
        else:
            vects.append(dlib.vector([0]))
    return vects


# Dlib also supports the use of a sparse vector representation.  This is more
# efficient than the above form when you have very high dimensional vectors that
# are mostly full of zeros.  In dlib, each sparse vector is represented as an
# array of pair objects.  Each pair contains an index and value.  Any index not
# listed in the vector is implicitly associated with a value of zero.
# Additionally, when using sparse vectors with dlib.train_sequence_segmenter()
# you can use "unsorted" sparse vectors.  This means you can add the index/value
# pairs into your sparse vectors in any order you want and don't need to worry
# about them being in sorted order.
